# Notes:
# - lots of automated tests are performed in the CI pipeline, see .github/workflows/ci_automation_test.yml
#   They are performed on Windows and Linux after a pip install
# - this file is used to test binary wheels produced by cibuildwheel, and especially if imgui.create_context() works
#
# We skip windows, as GitHub Actions can't import imgui_bundle on Windows CI Runners in the wheel test
# (the error is: "ImportError: DLL load failed while importing imgui_bundle: The specified module could not be found.")
# GH Runners probably don't have the OpenGL DLLs required by imgui_bundle
# (this issue is solved in the pip.yml workflow, by installing the OpenGL DLLs)
