# Njal.la Python

![Njal.la Logo](njalla.svg)

## Description

This Python library provides a convenient interface for interacting with the Njal.la API, allowing users to seamlessly integrate Njal.la services into their Python applications.

## Installation

To install the library, use the following command:

```
pip install Njalla
```

## Usage

```python
import Njalla
# Initialize the Njal.la client
client = Njalla.Client(api_key="your_api_key")
```

## API Key

To use the library, you need to obtain an API key from Njal.la.
You can sign up for an account on [Njal.la website](https://njal.la/) and generate an API key in your account settings.

## Pronunciation

The library is named after "/ˈɲalla/" (Sami),
which refers to a small hut in the Sápmi forest, built to protect against predators.
This concept aligns with Njal.la's commitment to providing a secure and protective environment for online activities.

## License

This library is licensed under the `CC BY-NC-SA 4.0` License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## Classes

Njalla provides five different API classes.
You can use these simply by adding the class name on top of your Instance.\
Those are:
- API
- Domain
- Server
- VPN
- Wallet


```python
import Njalla

# Initialize the Njal.la client
client = Njalla.Client("your_api_key")

# API

print(client.API.add_token("comment", "from", "allowed_domains", "allowed_servers", "allowed_methods", "allowed_types", "acme"))

# Domain

print(client.Domain.register_domain("domain", "years"))

# Server

print(client.Server.add_traffic("id", "amount", "months", "starts_today"))

# VPN

print(client.VPN.add_vpn("name", "autorenew"))

# Wallet

print(client.Wallet.get_balance())
```

All the methods are also available in our (not yet existing) ReadTheDocs Documentation.\
You can find the documentation [here](https://njalla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) soon.
