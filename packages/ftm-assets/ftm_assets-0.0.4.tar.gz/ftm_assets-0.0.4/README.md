# ftm-assets

Resolve assets (currently images) related to [FollowTheMoney](https://followthemoney.tech) entities.

## Get images based on qid

```bash
cat entities.ftm.json | ftm-assets load-entities
```

## Run api server

```bash
uvicorn --port 8000 ftm_assets.api:app --workers 4
```

## Get asset metadata

For images:

```bash
curl https://localhost:8000/img/<entity_id>
```

```json
{
    "id": "<entity_id>",
    "url": "...",
    "alt": "...",
    "attribution": {
        "author": "...",
        "license": "...",
    }
}
```

## Run as an OpenAleph worker service

    pip install ftm-assets[openaleph]

To ingreate `ftm-assets` into the [OpenAleph](https://openaleph.org) ecosystem as a worker that processes entities, start the worker queue like this:

    PROCRASTINATE_APP=ftm_assets.tasks.app procrastinate worker -q ftm-assets

To defer tasks from other places, use `ftm-assets` as queue name and `ftm_assets.tasks.resolve_image` as the task identifier.

### Docker

Run the queue worker with changing the entrypoint to `procrastinate`:

    docker run ghcr.io/dataresearchcenter/ftm-asstets --entrypoint procrastinate worker -q ftm-assets
