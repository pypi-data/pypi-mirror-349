``yclept makedoc``
========================

The command-line tool `yclept makedoc` allows you to generate an RST-style document tree from your base configuration file.  For example, if you have a base configuration file called `base.yaml` and your package is structured like this:

.. code-block:: console

   rootdir/
     mypackage/
       __init__.py
       config.py
       data/
         __init__.py # so it can be imported like a module
         base.yaml
       docs/
         source/
           intro.rst
       otherstuff/
         stuff.py
     setup.py
     README.md

To use ``yclept makedoc``, you would first change to the ``docs/source`` directory and then run the command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd docs/source 
   $ yclept makedoc ../../data/base.yaml --root config_ref

This will generate a document tree rooted in ``docs/source/config_ref/``.  To see an example of this, visit `pestifer's documentation <https://pestifer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, and specifically the `configuration file reference <https://pestifer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_ref.html>`_.  Every thing under that link was generated by ``yclept makedoc``.
