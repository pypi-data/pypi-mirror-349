      content:
      - text: This document appears to be a sample PDF file that primarily contains Lorem ipsum text, which is placeholder
          text commonly used in design and publishing. The document begins with "Sample PDF" and states "This is a simple
          PDF file. Fun fun fun." followed by several paragraphs of Lorem ipsum text. The content doesn't convey any meaningful
          information as Lorem ipsum is essentially dummy text used to demonstrate the visual form of a document without the
          distraction of meaningful content.
