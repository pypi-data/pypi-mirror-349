# This is a compose file that creates an environment in which you can
# run tests.  Either just do
#
#   docker compose run runtests
#
# or, do
#
#   docker compose up -d shell
#
# to get a shell session running the SNPIT cpu image.  Connect to it
# with
#
#   docker compose exec -it shell /bin/bash
#
# You can now do things in there, including
#
#   cd /snappl/snappl/tests
#   pytest -v
