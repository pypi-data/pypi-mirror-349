This package provides a reliable upload service using the [gridworks-protocol]. 

The upload services communicates upstream using MQTT. Clients deliver data to
the service for reliable delivery using http. For [example](./src/gwupload/stubs/client/client.py): 

```python
    import random
    import time
    from typing import Literal
    
    import httpx
    from gwproto.messages import EventBase
    
    
    class SomeData(EventBase):
        TimestampUTC: float
        Reading: float
        TypeName: Literal["gridworks.event.some.data"] = "gridworks.event.some.data"
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        httpx.post(
            "http://127.0.0.1:8080/events",
            json=SomeData(
                TimestampUTC=round(time.time(), 3),
                Reading=round(random.random(), 3),
            ).model_dump(),
        )
```

## Experimentation

To experiment with this package you must run the upload service, and, if you
want to watch your messages delivered to a stub ingester, you must also run an
MQTT broker and the stub ingester. 

To set up the MQTT broker, follow the [gridworks-proactor instructions].

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv python install 3.12
uv tool install -p 3.12 poetry=1.8.5
git clone https://github.com/SmoothStoneComputing/gridworks-uploader.git
cd gridworks-uploader
```
Create a `.env` file at the location returned by: 
```shell
gwup envfile
```

with these contents:
```
UPLOADER_APP_lONG_NAME = "test.uploader"
UPLOADER_APP_INGESTER_LONG_NAME = "test.ingester"
STUB_INGESTER_APP_lONG_NAME = "test.ingester"
STUB_INGESTER_APP_UPLOADER_LONG_NAME = "test.uploader"
```

Create local test certificate authority:
```shell
poetry install --sync --with dev
poetry shell
gwcert ca create test-ca
```

Generate test certs for the uploader and the stub ingester:
```shell
gwup gen-test-certs
gwup stubs ingester gen-test-certs
```

Open 3 terminals. In each terminal, cd to the gridworks-uploader repo and run:
```shell
poetry shell
```

In the ingester terminal run:
```shell
gwup stubs ingester run --log-events
```

In the uploader terminal run:
```shell 
gwup run --message-summary
```

In the client terminal run:
```shell
gwup stubs client run 
```

Or:
```shell
python src/gwupload/stubs/client/client.py 
```
