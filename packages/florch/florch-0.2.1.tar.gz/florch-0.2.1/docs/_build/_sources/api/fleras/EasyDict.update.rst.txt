.. py:method:: fleras.EasyDict.update(e=None, **f)

   D.update([E, ]**F) -> None.  Update D from dict/iterable E and F.
   If E is present and has a .keys() method, then does:  for k in E: D[k] = E[k]
   If E is present and lacks a .keys() method, then does:  for k, v in E: D[k] = v
   In either case, this is followed by: for k in F:  D[k] = F[k]
