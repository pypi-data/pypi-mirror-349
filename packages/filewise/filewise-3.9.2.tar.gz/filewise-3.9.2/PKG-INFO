**filewise** is a Python toolkit designed to simplify file operations and management. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for file handling, directory management, and file system operations, making it easier to work with files in Python applications.

## Features

- **File Operations**:
  - Advanced file reading and writing
  - File type detection and handling
  - File compression and decompression
- **Directory Management**:
  - Directory creation and cleanup
  - File system navigation
  - Path manipulation utilities
- **File System Tools**:
  - File system monitoring
  - File pattern matching
  - File metadata handling
- **Data Processing**:
  - File-based data processing
  - Batch file operations
  - File format conversion

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing, please ensure the following dependencies are available on your system:

- **Required Third-Party Libraries**:

  ```bash
  pip install PyYAML pandas numpy
  ```

  Or via Anaconda (recommended channel: `conda-forge`):

  ```bash
  conda install -c conda-forge pyyaml pandas numpy
  ```

### Installation (from PyPI)

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install filewise
```

### Development Installation

For development purposes, you can install the package in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/filewise.git
cd filewise
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from filewise.operations import FileHandler
from filewise.directory import DirectoryManager

# Create a file handler
handler = FileHandler('data.txt')
handler.write('Hello, World!')

# Manage directories
manager = DirectoryManager('my_project')
manager.create_structure(['data', 'output', 'logs'])
```

### Advanced Example

```python
from filewise.filesystem import FileSystem
from filewise.processing import BatchProcessor

# Monitor file system changes
fs = FileSystem('watch_directory')
fs.watch_for_changes(callback=process_changes)

# Process files in batch
processor = BatchProcessor('input_directory')
processor.process_files(
    pattern='*.csv',
    processor=convert_to_parquet
)
```
