This module links sales order lines to slide.channel.partner
participations when selling a course. It does not add new views or user
interface elements but ensures that when a course is sold through Odoo's
eLearning system, the corresponding sales order line is associated with
the participation record.

This functionality is useful for:

- Tracking which sale order line is responsible for a given course
  participation.
- Ensuring better traceability between sales and enrollments.
- Serving as a base for other modules that may extend its logic.
