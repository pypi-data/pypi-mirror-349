Description
-----------
The ``gpu_tracker`` package provides a ``Tracker`` class and a commandline-interface that tracks (profiles) the usage of compute time, CPU utilization, maximum RAM, GPU utilization, and maximum GPU RAM.
The compute time is a measurement of the real time taken by the task as opposed to the CPU-utilization time.
The GPU tracking is for both Nvidia and AMD GPUs and respectively uses the nvidia-smi and amd-smi command-line tools to pull GPU usage information. Also, if neither the appropriate Nvidia nor AMD driver is installed, then the GPU-related metrics are not tracked and are reported as 0.
Computational resources are tracked throughout the duration of a context manager or the duration of explicit calls to the ``start()`` and ``stop()`` methods of the ``Tracker`` class.
The ``gpu-tracker`` command-line interface alternatively tracks the computational-resource-usage of an arbitrary shell command.

**NOTE: The tracking occurs in a separate process. To maximize the accuracy of the reported resource usage, you may want to have a core available solely for the tracking process e.g. if your job uses 3 workers, you may want to allocate 4 cores.**

**NOTE: Since the tracking process is created using the Python multiprocessing library, if done so using the "spawn" start method (default on MacOS and Windows) or the "forkserver" method, you may get a runtime error after starting the tracking. To prevent this, you'll need to start the tracker after checking** ``if __name__ == '__main__'``. **See "Safe importing of main module" under** `The spawn and forkserver start methods <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#the-spawn-and-forkserver-start-methods>`__ **for more information.**
