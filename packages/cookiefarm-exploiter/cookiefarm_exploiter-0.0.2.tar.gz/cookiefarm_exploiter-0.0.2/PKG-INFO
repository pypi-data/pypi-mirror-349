> Python decorator for automating exploit execution in CTF Attack & Defense competitions

---

## 📦 What is it?

This package provides a **`@exploiter_manager` decorator** designed to automate the parallel execution of exploits in CTF (*Attack & Defense*) settings, specifically for use with the [CookieFarm](https://github.com/BytesTheCookies/CookieFarm) project.

It handles:

* Authentication with the central server
* Retrieving team configuration
* Asynchronous dispatch of exploits to multiple targets
* Automatic flag parsing from `stdout`

> ⚠️ **Note:** This package is **not standalone**. It must be used together with the [CookieFarm client](https://github.com/BytesTheCookies/CookieFarm). The client provides the required APIs and team configurations.

---

## ⚙️ How it works

The `@exploiter_manager` decorator takes care of:

* Calling your `exploit(ip, port, name_service)` function
* Capturing your exploit's `stdout`
* Parsing flags via regex
* Logging the result in JSON format, including: team ID, port, service name, and the flag found

All of this is done in parallel using `asyncio` and `ThreadPoolExecutor`, making the process **extremely efficient**, even with dozens of teams.

---

## 🚀 Example usage

```python
from cookiefarm import exploiter_manager
import requests

@exploiter_manager
def exploit(ip, port, name_service):
    # Run your exploit here
    response = requests.get(f"http://{ip}:{port}/")

    # Just print the flag to stdout
    print(response.text)

# Run from the command line with arguments from CookieFarm
# python3 myexploit.py <ip_server> <password> <tick_time> <flag_regex> <thread_number> <port> <name_service>
```

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python ≥ 3.10
* `requests` (for HTTP-based exploits)
* Working CookieFarm client installed
