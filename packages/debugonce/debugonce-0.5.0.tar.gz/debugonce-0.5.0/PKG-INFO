# debugonce

`debugonce` is a Python utility designed to help developers effortlessly capture and reproduce bugs by recording function calls and runtime context. With the `@debugonce` decorator, you can easily log input arguments, environment variables, and more, making it simpler to diagnose issues in your code.

## Key Features

- **@debugonce Decorator**: Capture input arguments, environment variables, current working directory, Python version, and stack traces upon exceptions.
- **Optional Logging**: Capture contents of accessed files and HTTP requests if opted-in.
- **Storage**: All captured data is stored in a `.debugonce/` folder as JSON files.
- **Command-Line Interface**: A CLI tool (`debugonce-cli`) with commands to inspect, replay, export, list, and clean captured sessions.
- **File Access Tracking:**  Added explicit mention of file access tracking in the "Key Features" section.


## Installation

To install `debugonce`, paste the following command in your terminal or code editor. (use pip) :

```bash
pip install debugonce
```
<!-- or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sujith-sunny/debugonce.git
cd debugonce
pip install .
``` -->

## Usage

To use the `@debugonce` decorator, simply apply it to your function:

```python
from debugonce_packages import debugonce

@debugonce
def my_function(arg1, arg2):
    # Your function logic here
```

When the function is executed, the state (arguments, environment, etc.) will be captured and saved to a JSON file in the .debugonce/ directory.

## CLI Guide

The `debugonce-cli` provides several commands:

- **inspect**: Inspect a captured session. Displays a summary of the function's arguments, result, and any exceptions that occurred.

  ```bash
  debugonce-cli inspect .debugonce/session_<timestamp>.json
  ```

- **replay**: Replay a captured session by executing the exported script. Executes the _replay.py script generated from the export, which attempts to recreate the function call.
  
  ```bash
  debugonce-cli replay .debugonce/session_<timestamp>.json
  ```

- **export**: Generate a standalone bug reproduction script. Creates a Python script (_replay.py) that includes the function's code and attempts to reproduce the captured function call.
  
  ```bash
  debugonce-cli export .debugonce/session_<timestamp>.json

- **list**: Show all captured sessions.
  
  ```bash
  debugonce-cli list
  ```

- **clean**: Clear stored sessions.
  
  ```bash
  debugonce-cli clean
  ```

## Example Outputs

After running a function decorated with `@debugonce`, you will find the captured data in the `.debugonce/` folder. This includes:

- `session_<timestamp>.json`: Contains input arguments and environment details.
- `traceback_<timestamp>.log`: Logs the stack trace if an exception occurred.
