cd firecracker-python
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -e .
```

### Features

- Easily create microVMs with default or custom settings
- View a list of all running microVMs
- Access and modify microVM settings
- Remove one or all microVMs
- Connect to microVMs using SSH
- Set up port forwarding in microVMs

### Getting Started

To get started with **firecracker-python**, go to the [getting start guide](docs/getting-started.md)

### Usage

Here are some examples of how to use the library.

#### Create a microVM with custom configuration and list them all.

```python
from firecracker import MicroVM

vm = MicroVM(id="<vm_id>", vcpu=2, mem_size_mib=4096)
vm.create()

vms = MicroVM.list()
for vm in vms:
    print(f"VM with id {vm['id']} has IP {vm['ip_addr']} and is in state {vm['state']}")
```

#### Delete a microVM by id or all microVMs

```python
from firecracker import MicroVM

vm = MicroVM(id="<vm_id>")
vm.delete()         # Delete a single microVM by id
# Or
vm.delete(all=True) # Delete all microVMs
```

#### Enable port forwarding

```python
from firecracker import MicroVM

vm = MicroVM()
vm.create()

vm.port_forward(host_port=10222, dest_port=22)
# [2025-03-20T07:45:52.215] [INFO] Added nftables port forwarding rule
# 'Port forwarding active: x.x.x.x:10222 -> 172.16.0.2:22'

vm.port_forward(host_port=10222, dest_port=22, remove=True)
# [2025-03-20T07:46:11.062] [INFO] Found postrouting rule with handle 16
# [2025-03-20T07:46:11.062] [INFO] Prerouting rule: 172.16.0.2:22
# [2025-03-20T07:46:11.062] [INFO] Found prerouting rule with handle 17
# [2025-03-20T07:46:11.063] [INFO] Prerouting rule with handle 17 deleted
# [2025-03-20T07:46:11.065] [INFO] Postrouting rule with handle 16 deleted
# 'Port forwarding rule removed: x.x.x.x:10222 -> 172.16.0.2:22'
