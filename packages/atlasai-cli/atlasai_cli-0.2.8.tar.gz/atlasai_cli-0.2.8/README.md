## Why a separate package?

AtlasAI-CLI was born as part of [AtlasServer-Core v0.2.5](https://github.com/AtlasServer-Core/AtlasServer-Core/releases/tag/v0.2.5), but is now distributed as an independent package to:

- **Reduce dependencies**: AtlasServer-Core stays lighter
- **Better performance**: Faster installation when AI functions aren't needed
- **Flexibility**: Usable with or without AtlasServer-Core
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner and more modular codebase
- **Customization**: Freedom to choose between local Ollama or cloud-based OpenAI

## Main features

### 🔍 Intelligent Project Analysis
- **Framework detection**: Automatically identifies Flask, FastAPI, Django and others
- **Interactive exploration**: Analyzes the structure and key files of the project
- **Contextual recommendations**: Suggests specific commands, ports and environment variables

### 🌐 Multiple AI providers
- **Ollama**: Local models for privacy and offline operation
- **OpenAI**: Cloud models for advanced analysis

### 🌍 Multilingual support
- Explanations in English or Spanish according to preference

### 💻 [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) terminal interface
- Enhanced visualization with [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)
- Real-time responses through streaming
- Panels, tables and Markdown format for better readability

## Installation

### As a standalone tool:
```bash
pip install atlasai-cli
```

### With AtlasServer-Core:
```bash
pip install atlasserver atlasai-cli
```

### Requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) (to use local models)

## Usage

### Configuration:

```bash
# Setup with Ollama (local)
atlasai ai setup --provider ollama --model llama3:8b

# Setup with OpenAI (cloud)
atlasai ai setup --provider openai --model gpt-4.1 --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Project analysis:

```bash
# Basic analysis
atlasai ai suggest ~/path/to/my-project

# With language preference
atlasai ai suggest ~/path/to/my-project --language es

# With debug mode
atlasai ai suggest ~/path/to/my-project --debug
```

### Integration with AtlasServer-Core:

If you have AtlasServer-Core installed, you can use the same commands with the `atlasserver` prefix:

```bash
atlasserver ai setup --provider ollama --model llama3:8b
atlasserver ai suggest ~/path/to/my-project
```
