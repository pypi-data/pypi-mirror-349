# whether to enable project activation/switching between the projects defined below using the

# Note that if this is enabled, then per-project tool activation will be handled within Serena,
# i.e. Serena will provide all tools but will disallow the execution of tools that are not enabled for

# Add your list of projects here (which you can switch between using "activate_project").
# Every list item must be either
#   - a path to a .yml file, absolute or relative to the directory this
#     configuration file is in (e.g. "myproject.yml" or "/path/to/wherever/myproject.yml").
#     In this case, the name of the project will be the base filename of the .yml file
#     (e.g. "myproject" for "myproject.yml").
#   - or a path to the project's root directory (e.g. "/path/to/myproject"), with the
#     configuration file being located in "/path/to/myproject/.serena/project.yml".
#     In this case, the name of the project will be the name of the directory ("myproject").

# Whether to open a graphical window with Serena's logs (not supported on macOS).
# This is useful both for troubleshooting and for monitoring the tool calls,
# especially when using the agno playground, since the tool calls are not always shown,
# and the input params are never shown in the agno UI.
# When used as MCP server for Claude Desktop, the logs are primarily for troubleshooting.
# Note: unfortunately, the various entities starting the Serena server or agent do so in
# mysterious ways, often starting multiple instances of the process without shutting down
# previous instances. This leads to multiple log windows being opened, and only the last
# window being updated. Since we can't control how agno or Claude Desktop start Serena,
# we have to live with this limitation for now.
#
# Limitations: doesn't seem to work with the community version of Claude Desktop for Linux
# Might also cause problems with some MCP clients - if you have any issues, try disabling this
