# Dedal

This repository provides functionalities to easily **managed spack environments** and
**helpers for the container image build flow**.

This library was tested on Ubuntu operating system.

**Setting up the needed environment variables**
The ````<checkout path>\dedal\.env```` file contains the environment variables required for OCI registry used for
caching.
Ensure that you edit the ````<checkout path>\dedal\.env```` file to match your environment.
The following provides an explanation of the various environment variables:

       # OCI Registry Configuration Sample for concretization caches
       # =============================
       # The following variables configure the Harbor docker OCI registry (EBRAINS) used for caching.
       
       # The hostname of the OCI registry. e.g. docker-registry.ebrains.eu
       CONCRETIZE__OCI_HOST="docker-registry.ebrains.eu"
       
       # The project name in the Docker registry.
       CONCRETIZE__OCI_PROJECT="concretize_caches"
       
       # The username used for authentication with the Docker registry.
       CONCRETIZE__OCI_USERNAME="robot$concretize-cache-test+user"
       
       # The password used for authentication with the Docker registry.
       CONCRETIZE_OCI_PASSWORD="###ACCESS_TOKEN###"
        

       # OCI Registry Configuration Sample for binary caches
       # =============================
       # The following variables configure the Harbor docker OCI registry (EBRAINS) used for caching.
       
       # The hostname of the OCI registry. e.g. docker-registry.ebrains.eu
       BUILDCACHE_OCI_HOST="docker-registry.ebrains.eu"
       
       # The project name in the Docker registry.
       BUILDCACHE_OCI_PROJECT="binary-cache-test"
       
       # The username used for authentication with the Docker registry.
       BUILDCACHE_OCI_USERNAME="robot$binary-cache-test+user"
       
       # The password used for authentication with the Docker registry.
       BUILDCACHE_OCI_PASSWORD="###ACCESS_TOKEN###"

For both concretization and binary caches, the cache version can be changed via the attributes
```cache_version_concretize``` and ```cache_version_build```.
The default values are ```v1```.

Before using this library, the following tool must be installed on Linux distribution:

````
    apt install -y bzip2 ca-certificates g++ gcc gfortran git gzip lsb-release patch python3 python3-pip tar unzip xz-utils zstd
````

````
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
````
