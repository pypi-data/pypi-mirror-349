# Prune's Captcha

## What is it for?

Captcha helps prevent robots from spamming using your forms.

## Prerequisites

-   To be installed on a Prune Django project that uses poetry or UV

## UV project

### Installation

Run the following command in the console:

```bash
uv add captcha_prune
```

### Updating the captcha

Don't hesitate to regularly run `uv sync --upgrade`, as the captcha evolves with time and our practices!

## Poetry project

### Installation

Run the following command:

```bash
poetry add prune_captcha
```

### Updating the captcha

Don't hesitate to regularly run `poetry update`, as the captcha evolves with time and our practices!

## Captcha Integration

### Configuration

In `settings.py`, set the path to the images used for the puzzle:

```python
PUZZLE_IMAGE_STATIC_PATH = "website/static/website/images/puzzles/"
```

Important: You must import the static files (css, js) present in "captcha_prune/static/".

### Utilisation

-   GET request (form display)

    -   Use create_and_get_captcha to generate the captcha data:

        ```python
        from captcha_prune.utils import create_and_get_captcha
        ```

        ```python
        puzzle = create_and_get_captcha(request)
        ```

    -   Passes the data into the context under the puzzle variable:

        ```python
        return render(
            request,
            "website/pages/contact/page.html",
            {"form": form, "puzzle": puzzle},
        )
        ```

    -   Include the component in your template:

        ```
        {% include "captcha_prune/captcha.html" %}
        ```

-   POST request (form submission)

    -   Use verify_captcha to validate the captcha:

        ```python
        from captcha_prune.utils import verify_captcha
        ```

        ```python
        response = verify_captcha(request)
        ```

    -   True if the captcha is correct, else False.

    -   Redirects in case of incorrect captcha.
