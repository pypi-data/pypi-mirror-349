A place for all common pyhton code

## Python terminology

- package: A collection of modules, classes, and functions that are organized in a directory hierarchy, with an `__init__.py` file at the top level.
- package: A collection of modules that is normally published to PyPI and can be installed using pip.
- subpackage: A package that is contained within another package, allowing for a hierarchical organization of code.
- module: A single file containing Python code, which can be imported into other modules or scripts.
- script: A Python file that is intended to be run directly (not just imported).
- namespace: A package without an `__init__.py` file, used when splitting one logical package across multiple directories or distributions (rare in small projects).

## Adding a new subpackge

To add a new subpackage to the `platform` package, create a new directory with an `__init__.py` file inside it.
