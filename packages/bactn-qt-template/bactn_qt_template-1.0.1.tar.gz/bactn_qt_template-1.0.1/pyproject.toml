description = "A Thonny plugin to quickly insert a PyQt5 application template. Designed especially for Tunisian Bac students to make practicing Qt easier during exam prep. Some schools already use helpful tools like this — I hope it supports your learning too. Wishing you the best of luck in your finals (or any project you're working on)! Feel free to share with friends — and keep going, you're doing great! :3"
