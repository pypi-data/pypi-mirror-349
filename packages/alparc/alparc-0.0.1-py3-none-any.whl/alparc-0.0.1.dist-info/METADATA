# ALPARC
This is code for our work [The ALPARC Toolbox: Artificial Languages with Phonological and Acoustic Rhythmicity Control](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.24.595268)

## Setup
The following describes how you can set up the software and run the experiments from the paper.

### Install Package
The simplest is to clone this repository and install ALPARC in editable mode:
```shell
pip install -e .
```

If you want to use ALPARC as a package, you can install it directly from git with
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/milosen/alparc.git
```

## Run the code from the paper

Clone this repository. Install jupyter
```shell
pip install jupyter
```
If you use a virtual environement, you also need to install the ipython-kernel:
```shell
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=alparc
```
In this case, don't forget to select the `alparc` kernel in the jupyter session's kernel option (Kernel -> Change kernel -> alparc).

Start jupyter
```shell
jupyter notebook
```
and select the notebook you want. 

1.  `data_and_stats_from_the_paper.ipynb` reproduces the data for the figures and the appendices of the paper
2.  `plots_from_the_paper.ipynb` reproduces the figures in the publication
3.  *Optional*: If you want to adapt ALPARC to your own research, you'll probably want to take a closer look at ALPARCs internals. More notebooks on that can be found in the [ALPARC Workshop](https://github.com/milosen/alparc/workshop)
