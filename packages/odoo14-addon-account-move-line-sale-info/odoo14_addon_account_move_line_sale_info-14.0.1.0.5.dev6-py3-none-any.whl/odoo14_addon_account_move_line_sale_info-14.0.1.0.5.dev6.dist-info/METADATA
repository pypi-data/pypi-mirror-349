===========================
Account Move Line Sale Info
===========================

This module will add the sale order line to journal items.

The ultimate goal is to establish the purchase order line as one of the key
fields to reconcile the Goods Delivered Not Invoiced accrual account.


Usage
=====

The sale order line will be automatically copied to the journal items.

* When a supplier invoice is created referencing sales orders, the
  sale order line will be copied to the corresponding journal item.

* When a stock move is validated and generates a journal entry, the sale
  order line is copied to the account move line.
