    """
    Adjust simulation speed and update node positions based on the accumulated forces.

    This step is crucial for a 'continuous' layout:
    - We compute each node's "swing" (difference in direction from previous iteration).
    - We compute "traction" (overall magnitude of forces).
    - Then adapt the global speed to keep swinging under control.
    - Finally, apply the forces to update (x,y) positions.

    Args:
        nodes (list of Node):
            Nodes in the simulation.
        speed (float):
            Current global speed of the simulation (step size).
        speed_efficiency (float):
            Efficiency factor for speed adjustment, can go up or down
            depending on how stable the layout is.
            Typical range: starts around 1.0, can drift between [0.05, 10].
        jitter_tolerance (float):
            Tolerance for "oscillations." Lower => more stable but slower movement.
            Typical range: 0.1 to 10. Higher values => faster, less stable.
