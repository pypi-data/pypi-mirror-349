**peptacular** is an extremely lightweight package with only one dependency: ``regex``.

It contains functions for parsing and working with Proforma2.0 compliant peptide & protein sequences.

If you use **peptacular** in your research, please cite: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15054278

## Documentation

```bash
pip install peptacular
```

## Warnings

- The internal fragment ion mass calculation may not be accurate. Fairly certain that the ay, by, and cy internal fragments are correct.
- GNO and RESID mods are disabled for now since very few were able to be parsed.
- Project is still under development. I will be adding more features and fixing bugs as I find them.
