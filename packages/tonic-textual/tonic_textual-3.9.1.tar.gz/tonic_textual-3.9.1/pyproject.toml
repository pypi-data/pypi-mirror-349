# Numpy (which Pandas depends on) put out a version (1.21.1) that breaks on Python 3.11, but they did not mark it as incompatible with 3.11.
# In a following release (1.21.2), Numpy did mark it as incompatible with 3.11 to fix the issue.
# However, Poetry still tries to install the incompatible version as it's the only one that meets the requirements for ^3.7 when your machine is running Python 3.11.
# So we need to specify different versions of Pandas for different versions of Python to avoid it installing the faulty version.
