## Setup

Before submitting any calculations, you will need to install and configure
the Q-Cloud command line interface.  It is recommended to first create a
Python virtual environment and activate it before installing the qcloud_user
package
```
python3 -m venv qcloud_venv
source qcloud_venv/env/bin/activate

python3 -m pip install  qcloud_user
qcloud --configure
```
You can exit the virtual environment by typing `deactivate` in the terminal.
Make sure to reactivate (`source qcloud_venv/env/bin/activate`) before
running qcloud commands.

You will be prompted for several configuration values that can be obtained from
your Q-Cloud administrator.  Alternatively, if your administrator has provided
these details in a file, then you can provide the file name as an argument:
```
qcloud --configure user_info.txt
```
You should have received an email with an initial password for your account,
and you will be prompted to change this the first time you attempt to submit a
job.


## Job Control

### Submitting Jobs

Use the `--submit` option to submit Q-Chem jobs to the cluster, e.g.:
```
qcloud --submit job1.inp job2.inp [...]
```
Several jobs can be submitted at the same time and they will be submitted with
the default queue parameters.   If there are no compute nodes available, the
jobs will sit in the QUEUED state for a couple of minutes while a fresh compute
node is launched and configured.  Once the queue has cleared, the compute nodes
will automatically shut down after the configure time frame (default is five minutes).

Jobs will be submitted with the default queue parameters which are determined
during the cluster setup (contact your QCloud administrator for details).
Scratch space is set explicitly, memory is determined by the instance type
selected and compute time is unlimited.  If each job is run on a separate
instance (by requesting all the instance cores) then these are the relevant
default values. 

If you want to override these values, or pass additional parameters to the SLUM
scheduler, then you can add these to the first line of the input file as you
would specify command line options to sbatch.  For example: line of the Q-Chem
input file. For example, the following limits the job to 1 hour and memory to
4G: 
```
--time=1:00:00  --mem=4G
$molecule
0  1
he
$end
$rem
...
```
The number of threads can be specified by using the `--ncpu` flag, for example:
```
qcloud --submit --ncpu 4 job1.inp 
```
Note that if the number of threads specified exceeds the number of cores on 
an individual compute node, the job will not run.  Your QCloud administrator
will be able to inform you what this limit is.

If the job submission is successful, a unique job identifier will be returned:
```
[âœ“] Submitted job id gv6uqutvNmU0:             helium
```
A local registry of these IDs is kept, so it is not essential to use them in the
commands below. However, they may be required to disambiguate multiple jobs
submitted with the same input file basename.


### Monitoring Jobs

To monitor the progress of jobs, use the `--status` option along with a string, 
which could be the file name, job ID or substring:
```
qcloud --status <jobid|jobname> 
```

The progress of jobs in the RUNNING state can be obtained using:
```
qcloud --tail <jobid|jobname> 
```

A job in the QUEUED or RUNNING state can be cancelled, which will remove it from the queue:
```
qcloud --cancel <jobid|jobname>
```

### Downloading Results

Once a job in in the ARCHIVED state, it can be downloaded from the S3 bucket onto 
the local machine:
```
qcloud --get <pattern> 
```
The download will create a new directory with the same basename as the input file 
containing the output from the calculation.


Jobs in the DOWNLOADED state can be cleared from the job registry on the local machine:
```
qcloud --clear <pattern> 
```
Note that this does not remove the results from the S3 bucket.
If you want to remove the job from the registry regardless of status, use the
`--remove` option.


## Other commands

The following will give a full list of commands available using the CLI:
```
qcloud --help
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter additional problems not covered in this guide, please contact your 
Q-Cloud administrator or email support@q-chem.com for assistance.
