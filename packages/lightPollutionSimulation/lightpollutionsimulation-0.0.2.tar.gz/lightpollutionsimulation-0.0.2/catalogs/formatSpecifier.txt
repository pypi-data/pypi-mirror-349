    - The file name is expected to be contain the name of the catalog followed by the extension ".ocat"
    - The name of the catalog should be in all caps and should not contain any spaces or special characters.
    - The extension ".ocat" is used to identify the file as a catalog file.
    
File Format:
    - The file should be a plain text file.
    - Comments are allowed and should be preceded by a "#" symbol.
    - All non-comment lines are expected to contain valid catalog information in the format: "RA|DEC|IDENTIFIER"
    - The RA and DEC values should be in decimal degrees without the 'Â°' symbol.
    - The identifier should be a string that uniquely identifies the object.
    - Example: "001.6711| +8.3558|7834"
