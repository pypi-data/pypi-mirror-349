# Code Linting Guidelines

This document outlines our guidelines for code linting in our Python codebase.

## Core Principles

1. All code must pass all linting checks
2. We use multiple linters for different aspects of code quality
3. Linting is enforced in CI
4. Linting rules are defined in `pyproject.toml`

## Linting Tools

We use several linting tools:

1. `ruff` - Fast Python linter for style, complexity, and common errors
2. `bandit` - Security linter
3. `mypy` - Static type checker

## Linting Commands

### Run All Linters

To run all linting checks (including type checking):

```bash
uv run poe lint
```

This will run all linting checks in sequence:
- ruff checks
- bandit security checks
- mypy type checks

### Individual Linting Tasks

To run specific linting checks:

```bash
# Run ruff checks
uv run poe ruff_check

# Run bandit security checks
uv run poe bandit_check

# Run mypy type checks
uv run poe type_check
```

### Auto-fix Linting Issues

Some linting issues can be automatically fixed, but only those detected by ruff:

```bash
# Fix ruff issues that can be auto-fixed
uv run poe fix
```

Note that auto-fixing is only available for ruff issues. Issues detected by bandit or mypy must be fixed manually.

## When to Lint

1. After making any code changes
2. Before committing changes
3. After merging changes from other branches
4. Before creating a PR

## Common Linting Issues

### Ruff Issues

1. Unused imports
2. Line length violations
3. Missing docstrings
4. Unused variables
5. Style violations

### Bandit Issues

1. Hardcoded passwords
2. Insecure function calls
3. SQL injection risks
4. Shell injection risks
5. Insecure deserialization

### MyPy Issues

1. Missing type annotations
2. Type mismatches
3. Incorrect generic usage
4. Incompatible types
5. Unreachable code

## Examples

### Good Code (Passes All Linters)

```python
from collections.abc import AsyncGenerator
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from typing import Any

from psycopg import AsyncConnection
from psycopg.errors import DuplicateDatabase

from .exceptions import (
    AlreadyExistsError,
    DatabaseError,
    RoleError,
    UserError,
)


@asynccontextmanager
async def autocommit(
    conn: AsyncConnection,
) -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncConnection, None]:
    """Temporarily set a connection to autocommit mode.

    Args:
        conn: The connection to modify
    Yields:
        The connection in autocommit mode
    """
    original_autocommit = conn.autocommit
    try:
        await conn.set_autocommit(True)
        yield conn
    finally:
        await conn.set_autocommit(original_autocommit)


class LoggingConnection(AsyncConnection):
    """Enhanced async psycopg connection with built-in SQL query logging."""

    def __init__(
        self,
        dsn: str,
        *,
        log_level: str = "INFO",
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> None:
        """Initialize a LoggingConnection instance."""
        super().__init__(dsn, **kwargs)
        self.log_level = log_level
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

### Bad Code (Fails Linters)

```python
# Fails ruff: unused import
from typing import Any, TypeAlias

# Fails ruff: line too long
from psycopg import AsyncConnection; from psycopg.errors import DuplicateDatabase

# Fails ruff: missing docstring
class LoggingConnection:
    def __init__(self, dsn, log_level="INFO", **kwargs):
        # Fails mypy: missing type annotations
        super().__init__(dsn, **kwargs)
        self.log_level = log_level
        # Fails bandit: hardcoded password
        self.password = "secret123"
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Fails ruff: unused variable
async def get_current_user(conn):
    result = await conn.execute("SELECT current_user")
    row = await result.fetchone()
    if row is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Failed to get current user")
    return row[0]
```

## Best Practices

1. Run `uv run poe lint` after making any code changes
2. Run `uv run poe fix` to automatically fix ruff issues
3. Address all linting errors before committing
4. Don't disable linting rules without good reason
5. If you need to disable a linting rule:
   - Add a comment explaining why
   - Consider if there's a better way to write the code
   - Get approval from a maintainer

## Rationale

1. Linting helps catch bugs early
2. Linting enforces consistent code style
3. Linting improves code security
4. Linting makes code reviews easier
5. Linting helps maintain code quality
