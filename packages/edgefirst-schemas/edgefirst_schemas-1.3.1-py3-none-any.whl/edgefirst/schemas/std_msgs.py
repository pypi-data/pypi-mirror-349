    The multiarray declares a generic multi-dimensional array of a
    particular data type.  Dimensions are ordered from outer most
    to inner most.

    Accessors should ALWAYS be written in terms of dimension stride
    and specified outer-most dimension first.

    multiarray(i,j,k) = data[data_offset + dim_stride[1]*i + dim_stride[2]*j + k]

    A standard, 3-channel 640x480 image with interleaved color channels
    would be specified as:

    dim[0].label  = "height"
    dim[0].size   = 480
    dim[0].stride = 3*640*480 = 921600  (note dim[0] stride is just size of image)
