      <p>This version of the ITER Physics Data Model follows the COCOS = 11 coordinate convention. The COCOS conventions are defined in [O. Sauter and S.Yu.

      <p>For conversion between cylindrical (R,phi,Z) and Cartesian (X,Y,Z) coordinates, IMAS
         follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_31-11">ISO 31-11 standard</a>, namely the origin and Z axis align and the X axis corresponds to phi = 0</p>

      <p class="welcome">List of available Generic Structures</p>
      <p>Generic structures are data structures that can be found in various places of the
         Physics Data Model, as they are useful in several contexts. Typical examples are lists
         of standard spatial coordinates, description of plasma ion species, traceability /
         provenance information, etc.</p>
      <p>This list of available generic structures is not restrictive since it can be freely
         expanded by Data Model designers. Note that the structure name is not the name of
         a Data Model node, therefore the generic structure names do not appear in the Data
         Dictionary HTML documentation. They are primarily used for the design of the Data
         Dictionary, but also they can be used in Fortran codes where they are implemented
         as derived types.
