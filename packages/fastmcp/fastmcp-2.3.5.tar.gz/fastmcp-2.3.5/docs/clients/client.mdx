<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

The `fastmcp.Client` provides a high-level, asynchronous interface for interacting with any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, whether it's built with FastMCP or another implementation. It simplifies communication by handling protocol details and connection management.

## FastMCP Client

The FastMCP Client architecture separates the protocol logic (`Client`) from the connection mechanism (`Transport`).

- **`Client`**: Handles sending MCP requests (like `tools/call`, `resources/read`), receiving responses, and managing callbacks.
- **`Transport`**: Responsible for establishing and maintaining the connection to the server (e.g., via WebSockets, SSE, Stdio, or in-memory).

```python
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP
from fastmcp.client import (
    RootsHandler,
    RootsList,
    LogHandler,
    MessageHandler,
    SamplingHandler,
    ProgressHandler  # For handling progress notifications
)
```

### Transports

Clients must be initialized with a `transport`. You can either provide an already instantiated transport object, or provide a transport source and let FastMCP attempt to infer the correct transport to use.

The following inference rules are used to determine the appropriate `ClientTransport` based on the input type:

1.  **`ClientTransport` Instance**: If you provide an already instantiated transport object, it's used directly.
2.  **`FastMCP` Instance**: Creates a `FastMCPTransport` for efficient in-memory communication (ideal for testing).
3.  **`Path` or `str` pointing to an existing file**:
    *   If it ends with `.py`: Creates a `PythonStdioTransport` to run the script using `python`.
    *   If it ends with `.js`: Creates a `NodeStdioTransport` to run the script using `node`.
4.  **`AnyUrl` or `str` pointing to a URL that begins with `http://` or `https://`**:
    *   Creates a `StreamableHttpTransport`
5.  **Other**: Raises a `ValueError` if the type cannot be inferred.

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

# Example transports (more details in Transports page)
server_instance = FastMCP(name="TestServer") # In-memory server
http_url = "https://example.com/mcp"        # HTTP server URL
ws_url = "ws://localhost:9000"             # WebSocket server URL
server_script = "my_mcp_server.py"         # Path to a Python server file

# Client automatically infers the transport type
client_in_memory = Client(server_instance)
client_http = Client(http_url)
client_ws = Client(ws_url)
client_stdio = Client(server_script)

print(client_in_memory.transport)
print(client_http.transport)
print(client_ws.transport)
print(client_stdio.transport)

# Expected Output (types may vary slightly based on environment):
# <FastMCP(server='TestServer')>
# <StreamableHttp(url='https://example.com/mcp')>
# <WebSocket(url='ws://localhost:9000')>
# <PythonStdioTransport(command='python', args=['/path/to/your/my_mcp_server.py'])>
```
<Tip>
For more control over connection details (like headers for SSE, environment variables for Stdio), you can instantiate the specific `ClientTransport` class yourself and pass it to the `Client`. See the [Transports](/clients/transports) page for details.
</Tip>

## Client Usage

### Connection Lifecycle

The client operates asynchronously and must be used within an `async with` block. This context manager handles establishing the connection, initializing the MCP session, and cleaning up resources upon exit.

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client("my_mcp_server.py") # Assumes my_mcp_server.py exists

async def main():
    # Connection is established here
    async with client:
        print(f"Client connected: {client.is_connected()}")

        # Make MCP calls within the context
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        print(f"Available tools: {tools}")

        if any(tool.name == "greet" for tool in tools):
            result = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": "World"})
            print(f"Greet result: {result}")

    # Connection is closed automatically here
    print(f"Client connected: {client.is_connected()}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

You can make multiple calls to the server within the same `async with` block using the established session.

### Client Methods

The `Client` provides methods corresponding to standard MCP requests:

<Warning>
The standard client methods return user-friendly representations that may change as the protocol evolves. For consistent access to the complete data structure, use the `*_mcp` methods described later.
</Warning>

#### Tool Operations

*   **`list_tools()`**: Retrieves a list of tools available on the server.
    ```python
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    # tools -> list[mcp.types.Tool]
    ```
*   **`call_tool(name: str, arguments: dict[str, Any] | None = None, timeout: float | None = None, progress_handler: ProgressHandler | None = None)`**: Executes a tool on the server.
    ```python
    result = await client.call_tool("add", {"a": 5, "b": 3})
    # result -> list[mcp.types.TextContent | mcp.types.ImageContent | ...]
    print(result[0].text) # Assuming TextContent, e.g., '8'
    
    # With timeout (aborts if execution takes longer than 2 seconds)
    result = await client.call_tool("long_running_task", {"param": "value"}, timeout=2.0)
    
    # With progress handler (to track execution progress)
    result = await client.call_tool(
        "long_running_task",
        {"param": "value"},
        progress_handler=my_progress_handler
    )
    ```
    *   Arguments are passed as a dictionary. FastMCP servers automatically handle JSON string parsing for complex types if needed.
    *   Returns a list of content objects (usually `TextContent` or `ImageContent`).
    *   The optional `timeout` parameter limits the maximum execution time (in seconds) for this specific call, overriding any client-level timeout.
    *   The optional `progress_handler` parameter receives progress updates during execution, overriding any client-level progress handler.

#### Resource Operations

*   **`list_resources()`**: Retrieves a list of static resources.
    ```python
    resources = await client.list_resources()
    # resources -> list[mcp.types.Resource]
    ```
*   **`list_resource_templates()`**: Retrieves a list of resource templates.
    ```python
    templates = await client.list_resource_templates()
    # templates -> list[mcp.types.ResourceTemplate]
    ```
*   **`read_resource(uri: str | AnyUrl)`**: Reads the content of a resource or a resolved template.
    ```python
    # Read a static resource
    readme_content = await client.read_resource("file:///path/to/README.md")
    # readme_content -> list[mcp.types.TextResourceContents | mcp.types.BlobResourceContents]
    print(readme_content[0].text) # Assuming text

    # Read a resource generated from a template
    weather_content = await client.read_resource("data://weather/london")
    print(weather_content[0].text) # Assuming text JSON
    ```

#### Prompt Operations

*   **`list_prompts()`**: Retrieves available prompt templates.
*   **`get_prompt(name: str, arguments: dict[str, Any] | None = None)`**: Retrieves a rendered prompt message list.

### Raw MCP Protocol Objects

<VersionBadge version="2.2.7" />

The FastMCP client attempts to provide a "friendly" interface to the MCP protocol, but sometimes you may need access to the raw MCP protocol objects. Each of the main client methods that returns data has a corresponding `*_mcp` method that returns the raw MCP protocol objects directly.

<Warning>
The standard client methods (without `_mcp`) return user-friendly representations of MCP data, while `*_mcp` methods will always return the complete MCP protocol objects. As the protocol evolves, changes to these user-friendly representations may occur and could potentially be breaking. If you need consistent, stable access to the full data structure, prefer using the `*_mcp` methods.
</Warning>

```python
# Standard method - returns just the list of tools
tools = await client.list_tools()
# tools -> list[mcp.types.Tool]

# Raw MCP method - returns the full protocol object
result = await client.list_tools_mcp()
# result -> mcp.types.ListToolsResult
tools = result.tools
```

Available raw MCP methods:

*   **`list_tools_mcp()`**: Returns `mcp.types.ListToolsResult`
*   **`call_tool_mcp(name, arguments)`**: Returns `mcp.types.CallToolResult`
*   **`list_resources_mcp()`**: Returns `mcp.types.ListResourcesResult`
*   **`list_resource_templates_mcp()`**: Returns `mcp.types.ListResourceTemplatesResult`
*   **`read_resource_mcp(uri)`**: Returns `mcp.types.ReadResourceResult`
*   **`list_prompts_mcp()`**: Returns `mcp.types.ListPromptsResult`
*   **`get_prompt_mcp(name, arguments)`**: Returns `mcp.types.GetPromptResult`
*   **`complete_mcp(ref, argument)`**: Returns `mcp.types.CompleteResult`

These methods are especially useful for debugging or when you need to access metadata or fields that aren't exposed by the simplified methods.

### Advanced Features

MCP allows servers to interact with clients in order to provide additional capabilities. The `Client` constructor accepts additional configuration to handle these server requests.

#### Timeout Control

<VersionBadge version="2.3.4" />

You can control request timeouts at both the client level and individual request level:

```python
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.exceptions import McpError

# Client with a global 5-second timeout for all requests
client = Client(
    my_mcp_server,
    timeout=5.0  # Default timeout in seconds
)

async with client:
    # This uses the global 5-second timeout
    result1 = await client.call_tool("quick_task", {"param": "value"})
    
    # This specifies a 10-second timeout for this specific call
    result2 = await client.call_tool("slow_task", {"param": "value"}, timeout=10.0)
    
    try:
        # This will likely timeout
        result3 = await client.call_tool("medium_task", {"param": "value"}, timeout=0.01)
    except McpError as e:
        # Handle timeout error
        print(f"The task timed out: {e}")
```

<Warning>
Timeout behavior varies between transport types:

- With **SSE** transport, the per-request (tool call) timeout **always** takes precedence, regardless of which is lower.
- With **HTTP** transport, the **lower** of the two timeouts (client or tool call) takes precedence.

For consistent behavior across all transports, we recommend explicitly setting timeouts at the individual tool call level when needed, rather than relying on client-level timeouts.
</Warning>

#### Progress Tracking

<VersionBadge version="2.3.5" />

MCP servers can report progress during long-running operations. The client can set a progress handler to receive and process these updates.

```python
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.progress import ProgressHandler

# A simple progress handler that prints progress updates
async def my_progress_handler(
    progress: float, 
    total: float | None, 
    message: str | None
) -> None:
    """Handle progress updates from the server."""
    if total is not None:
        percent = (progress / total) * 100
        print(f"Progress: {percent:.1f}% ({progress}/{total})")
    else:
        print(f"Progress: {progress}")
    
    if message:
        print(f"Message: {message}")

# Set the progress handler at client level
client = Client(
    my_mcp_server,
    progress_handler=my_progress_handler
)
```

By default, FastMCP uses a handler that logs progress updates at the debug level. This default handler properly handles cases where `total` or `message` might be None.

You can override the progress handler for specific tool calls:

```python
# Client uses the default debug logger for progress
client = Client(my_mcp_server)

async with client:
    # Use default progress handler (debug logging)
    result1 = await client.call_tool("long_task", {"param": "value"})
    
    # Override with custom progress handler just for this call
    result2 = await client.call_tool(
        "another_task", 
        {"param": "value"}, 
        progress_handler=my_progress_handler
    )
```

A typical progress update includes:
- Current progress value (e.g., 2 of 5 steps completed)
- Total expected value (may be None)
- Status message (may be None)

#### LLM Sampling

MCP Servers can request LLM completions from clients. The client can provide a `sampling_handler` to handle these requests. The sampling handler receives a list of messages and other parameters from the server, and should return a string completion.

The following example uses the `marvin` library to generate a completion:

```python {8-17, 21}
import marvin
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.sampling import (
    SamplingMessage,
    SamplingParams,
    RequestContext,
)

async def sampling_handler(
    messages: list[SamplingMessage],
    params: SamplingParams,
    context: RequestContext
) -> str:
    return await marvin.say_async(
        message=[m.content.text for m in messages],
        instructions=params.systemPrompt,
    )

client = Client(
    ...,
    sampling_handler=sampling_handler,
)
```

#### Logging

MCP servers can emit logs to clients. The client can set a logging callback to receive these logs.

```python {4-5, 9}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.logging import LogHandler, LogMessage

async def my_log_handler(params: LogMessage):
    print(f"[Server Log - {params.level.upper()}] {params.logger or 'default'}: {params.data}")

client_with_logging = Client(
    ...,
    log_handler=my_log_handler,
)
```

#### Roots

Roots are a way for clients to inform servers about the resources they have access to or certain boundaries on their access. The server can use this information to adjust behavior or provide more accurate responses.

Servers can request roots from clients, and clients can notify servers when their roots change.

To set the roots when creating a client, users can either provide a list of roots (which can be a list of strings) or an async function that returns a list of roots.

<CodeGroup>
```python Static Roots {5}
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client(
    ..., 
    roots=["/path/to/root1", "/path/to/root2"],
)
```
```python Dynamic Roots Callback {4-6, 10}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.roots import RequestContext

async def roots_callback(context: RequestContext) -> list[str]:
    print(f"Server requested roots (Request ID: {context.request_id})")
    return ["/path/to/root1", "/path/to/root2"]

client = Client(
    ..., 
    roots=roots_callback,
)
```
</CodeGroup>
### Utility Methods

*   **`ping()`**: Sends a ping request to the server to verify connectivity.
    ```python
    async def check_connection():
        async with client:
            await client.ping()
            print("Server is reachable")
    ```

### Error Handling

When a `call_tool` request results in an error on the server (e.g., the tool function raised an exception), the `client.call_tool()` method will raise a `fastmcp.client.ClientError`.

```python
async def safe_call_tool():
    async with client:
        try:
            # Assume 'divide' tool exists and might raise ZeroDivisionError
            result = await client.call_tool("divide", {"a": 10, "b": 0})
            print(f"Result: {result}")
        except ClientError as e:
            print(f"Tool call failed: {e}")
        except ConnectionError as e:
            print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

# Example Output if division by zero occurs:
# Tool call failed: Division by zero is not allowed.
```

Other errors, like connection failures, will raise standard Python exceptions (e.g., `ConnectionError`, `TimeoutError`). 

<Tip>
The client transport often has its own error-handling mechanisms, so you can not always trap errors like those raised by `call_tool` outside of the `async with` block. Instead, you can use `call_tool_mcp()` to get the raw `mcp.types.CallToolResult` object and handle errors yourself by checking its `isError` attribute.
</Tip>
