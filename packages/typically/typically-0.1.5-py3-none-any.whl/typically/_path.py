This is a proxy for `pydantic.DirectoryPath`, which in turn is
just an annotated type for `pathlib.Path`.

It only validates that the path is actually a directory when used
as an attribute in a pydantic model.

Attempting to instantiate it will work but may show in a type error:
`Object of type "Annotated" is not callable`.

It would be used when you need to validate a path is a real directory
path, but only on the instantiation of a pydantic model the path is
an attribute of.

    Not sure what to call this. Would use `PathLike`,

    - PathLike
