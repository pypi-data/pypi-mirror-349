zCube (z3scn) developer kit for Python interacts with electric linear actuator from Dyadic System (SCN5 and SCN6) using Python script.

### zCube (z3) Extensions:

SCN5 and SCN6 Actuators management: z3scn and z3scnpro modules (contact us for the pro version, available on demand only)

### Main Features:

- very easy to use API
- device initialization and capability detection including a full setup of com port, stroke, speed, acceleration and power gain.
- stroke management (50, 100, 150 and 200 mm)
- move home and center functions
- accurate and fast positioning 
- alarm checking
- multi IDs for one COM port supported since v0.2.3
- optional functions are available in PRO version, contact us

### To use:

- Plug in and configure your SCN device (identify the com port)
- install the module
- modify the com port and stroke of the demo script if needed and run the script to test available features

*This source code, module, lib and all information, data, and algorithms
associated with it are subject to change without notice.*
