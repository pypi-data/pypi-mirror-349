# Welcome to the CTD Processing python package!

This is currently developing rapidly into a custom tool box to help with CTD data processing. It fully supports running Sea-Birds original processing modules, but also custom python ones. They can interchangeably be used as part of 'processing procedures', workflows of multiple processing steps in sequence on one or more data file. These procedures are defined by .toml configuration files.

## Current development goals
### Developing new custom processing modules
### A gui to easily build procedure configuration files
### The replacement of Sea-Birds executables by their python packages
