Short for `Py`thon `E`asy `I`nput `O`utput (`pyeio`) is a python library meant to simplify data I/O.

## Install

Run one of:

```sh
uv add pyeio
pip install pyeio
poetry add pyeio
```

## Quickstart

Note that base module re-exports all the builtin `io` types, so you can use this as a drop in replacement for that:

```python
import pyeio as io

io.StringIO(...)
```

<!-- 
## Features

### File Formats

### Cryptographic Algorithms

### Environment Variables

### File System

### Accelerated Utils

### CLI -->



<!-- ## Installation

This is currently very unstable, but the idea is to capture as much functionality as possible, consolidate it, simplify it, minimize dependencies (further down the line) and optimize stuff with rust.

In addition to a python library, it also comes with a CLI - currently very restricted but somewhat optimized, intended to replicate functionality found across other system utilities and CLIs.

For instance, to count the number of lines in a 15 GB `items.jsonl` file one could run:

```sh
wc -l items.jsonl
```

```sh
io wc -l items.jsonl
```

Runs anywhere from 10 to 20x faster. I suspect things will be very unstable for another few months.

Install format support with: `pip install 'pyeio[<formats>]'`

EG:

```sh
pip install 'pyeio[json,toml]'
```

## User Story

```python
import pyeio as po

po.load("path or url")

po.save(data, "path")
```
