AnyPyTools is a toolkit for working with the [AnyBody Modeling System (AMS)]
from Python. It enables reproduceable research with the AnyBody Modeling System, and bridges the gap to whole ecosystem of open source scientific Python.

The AnyPyTools Python package enables batch processing, parallization of model
simulations, model sensitivity studies, and parameter studies, using either
Monte-Carlo (random sampling) or Latin hypercube sampling. It makes reproducible
research much easier and replaces the tedious process of manually automating the
musculoskeletal simulations and aggregating the results.

If you use the library for publications please **cite as:**

> Lund et al., (2019). AnyPyTools: A Python package for reproducible research with the AnyBody Modeling System. Journal of Open Source Software, 4(33), 1108, <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01108>

## Installation

- Download and install the [pixi](https://pixi.sh) package manager
- After installation open a command prompt in you project directory and type:

```bash
pixi init
pixi add anypytools
pixi install
```

This will install a virtual environment with python, anypytools and all
dependencies. You can then run you scripts in the virtual environment by typing
by prefixing the command with `pixi run`: e.g. `pixi run python myscript.py`

The library is also available on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/AnyPyTools) for installing using `pip`.


## Usage

The simplest case:

```python
from anypytools import AnyPyProcess
app = AnyPyProcess()
macro = [
    'load "Model.main.any"',
    'operation Main.Study.InverseDynamics',
    'run',
]
app.start_macro(macro)
```
