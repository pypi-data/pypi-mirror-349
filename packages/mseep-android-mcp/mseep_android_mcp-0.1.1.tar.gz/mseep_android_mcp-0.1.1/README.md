# Android MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides programmatic control over
Android devices through ADB (Android Debug Bridge). This server exposes
various Android device management capabilities that can be accessed by MCP
clients like [Claude desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)
and Code editors
(e.g. [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol))

## Features

- ðŸ”§ ADB Command Execution
- ðŸ“¸ Device Screenshot Capture
- ðŸŽ¯ UI Layout Analysis
- ðŸ“± Device Package Management

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed and configured
- Android device or emulator (not tested)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minhalvp/android-mcp-server.git
cd android-mcp-server
```

2. Install dependencies:
This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for project
management via various methods of
[installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

```bash
uv python install 3.11
uv sync
```

## Configuration

The server uses a simple YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`) to specify the
target android device

### Customizing Configuration

1. Create a new configuration file:

```bash
touch config.yaml
```

2. Configure your device:

```yaml
device:
  name: "google-pixel-7-pro:5555" # Your device identifier from 'adb devices'
```

## Usage

An MCP client is needed to use this server. The Claude Desktop app is an example
of an MCP client. To use this server with Claude Desktop:

1. Locate your Claude Desktop configuration file:

   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the Android MCP server configuration to the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "android": {
      "command": "path/to/uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "path/to/android-mcp-server", "run", "server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace:

- `path/to/uv` with the actual path to your `uv` executable
- `path/to/android-mcp-server` with the absolute path to where you cloned this
repository

    """
```

```python
def execute_adb_command(command: str) -> str:
    """
    Executes an ADB command and returns the output.
    Args:
        command (str): The ADB command to execute
    Returns:
        str: The output of the ADB command
    """
```

```python
def get_uilayout() -> str:
    """
    Retrieves information about clickable elements in the current UI.
    Returns a formatted string containing details about each clickable element,

    Returns:
        Image: the screenshot
    """
```

```python
def get_package_action_intents(package_name: str) -> list[str]:
    """
    Get all non-data actions from Activity Resolver Table for a package
    Args:
        package_name (str): The name of the package to get actions for
    Returns:
        list[str]: A list of all non-data actions from the Activity Resolver
