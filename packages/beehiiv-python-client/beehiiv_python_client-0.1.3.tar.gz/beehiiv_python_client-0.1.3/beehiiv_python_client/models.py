# Example of a dataclass if you want to strongly type responses
# @dataclass
# class Publication:
#     id: str
#     name: str
#     organization_name: Optional[str] = None
#     referral_program_enabled: Optional[bool] = None
#     created: Optional[int] = None

#     # ... other fields

# This is a placeholder. For now, the client returns raw dictionaries.
# If you decide to use Pydantic or dataclasses, you would define them here
# and update the resource methods to return instances of these models.
