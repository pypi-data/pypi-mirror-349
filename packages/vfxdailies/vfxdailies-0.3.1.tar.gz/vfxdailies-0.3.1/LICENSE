                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software
and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains free software for
all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General
Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any
other works released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. To understand the concept, you should think of "free" as in
"free speech," not as in "free beer". Free software is a matter of
liberty, not price. To be more specific, the GNU General Public
License is a license for software and other kinds of works that
guarantees end users the four essential freedoms:

  0. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
  1. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to
     make it do what you wish. Access to the source code is a
     precondition for this.
  2. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your
     neighbor.
  3. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
     others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance
     to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a
     precondition for this.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that prevent
others from denying you these freedoms or asking you to surrender
the freedoms. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the software, you must pass
on the same freedoms to the recipients. You must make sure that they
receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two key
features: copyright and patent law. Using these laws, we make sure
that everyone has freedom to use, modify, and share the software,
while making sure that contributors cannot take away these freedoms.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.
 
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
  License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
  kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "You" means the licensee, or person using the program, who must
  comply with this License.

  "The Program" means any copyrighted work licensed under this
  License. Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  "Source Code" means the preferred form of the work for making
  modifications to it. For example, source code includes the
  corresponding machine-readable source code, object code, and
  any other code used to compile or link the program.

  "Object Code" means any version of the program that has been
  compiled or processed into machine-readable code.

  "Modifications" means any changes to the source code or object code
  that are derivative of the original work.

  "The License" means this document, the GNU General Public License,
  version 3.

  1. Source Code and Distribution of Object Code

  If you distribute copies of the Program, whether modified or
  unmodified, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
  received. You must distribute the source code, and you must either
  provide a written offer, valid for at least three years, to provide
  the source code, or include a copy of the source code with the
  distribution.

  2. Copyleft

  You may copy and distribute copies of the Program, modified or
  unmodified, but you must distribute the source code along with it
  under the terms of this License.

  3. Distribution of Modified Code

  If you modify the Program and distribute the modified version, you
  must make sure that the modified version also complies with the
  GPL-3.0.

  4. Patent Rights

  By distributing the Program, you provide the recipient a license to
  use your patent rights.

  5. No Warranty

  The Program is licensed "as is," without warranty of any kind, either
  express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of
  merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. See the GNU General
  Public License for more details.

  6. Acceptance

  By distributing or using the Program, you accept and agree to be
  bound by the terms of this License.
