# 🤖 GitGPT - Intelligent Commit Assistant

📄 This README is also available in: [Español](README.es.md)

GitGPT is an intelligent tool that automatically suggests **commit messages**, and also provides a basic **pull request template**, combining heuristics, project structure, and a Machine Learning model. It's perfect for developers who want to keep their commits consistent and clear without wasting time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Detects changes in **staged**, **unstaged**, and **untracked** files.
- Suggests commit messages based on:
  - The diff content (`git diff`)
  - The current branch name
  - The file type (code, documentation, style, test, etc.)
  - A **Machine Learning** model trained with common examples.
- Supports multiple approaches for message suggestions:
  - 🔬 ML Model
  - ⚙️ Heuristic approach
  - 🎯 Thematic approach
  - 🔍 Descriptive approach
- Option to create a new branch before committing.
- Clean and easy-to-use CLI interface.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git installed and configured
- Python dependencies (install via pip):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🛠 Installation

Clone the repository and copy `git_assistant` into the project repository you're working on:

```
https://github.com/LuisGH28/git_assitant.git
cd git_assitant
```

Then run the assistant:

```
python3 git_gpt.py
```

You can also install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install ai-git-assistant
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Detects modified files in the repository using `git status`.
2. Classifies the files by type (documentation, code, tests, etc.).
3. Extracts diffs (`git diff`) and relevant keywords.
4. Generates several commit suggestions using different strategies.
5. Allows you to select the most suitable message or write your own.
6. Creates a `.md` file with a basic PR suggestion template.

---

## 💬 Example

```
$ ./gitgpt.py

Do you want to create a new branch? (Y/y): n
ℹ️ You will continue working on the current branch: fix/login-issue

Adding files:
+ login.py
Files added successfully.

💡 Commit suggestion #1:

fix: fixed issue in login.py

Do you want to use this message? (Y/y), (N/n) for another option, or press enter to write your own: n

💡 Commit suggestion #2:

fix(login): authentication error corrected

Do you want to use this message? (Y/y), (N/n) for another option, or press enter to write your own: y

✅ Commit successfully created.
```

---

## 🧪 Model Training

The ML model is based on Naive Bayes with TF-IDF vectorization. You can retrain it manually if desired:

```
python3 -c "import gitgpt; gitgpt.train_model()"
```

This will generate the `gitgpt_model.pkl` file.

> The model is automatically trained if it doesn't exist or is corrupted.

---

## 🛠️ Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Run tests:

```
pytest
```
