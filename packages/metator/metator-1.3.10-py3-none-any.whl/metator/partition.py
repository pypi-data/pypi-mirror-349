"""Partition metaHiC network using Louvain or Leiden algorithm.

General utility function for generating bins from the network file using Louvain
algorithm. If an overlapping threshold is given, it will use the Hamming
distance to group together bins relatively closed (to avaoid to split genomes in
different bins).

Core functions to partition the network are:
    - algo_partition
    - build_clustering_matrix
    - defined_overlapping_bins
    - detect_core_bins
    - generate_fasta
    - get_distances_splitmat

    - louvain_iterations_cpp
    - partition
