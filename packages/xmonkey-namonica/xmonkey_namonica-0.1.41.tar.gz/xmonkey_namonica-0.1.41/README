Xmonkey Namonica - Purl2Notices
===============================

Summary
-------
Xmonkey Namonica (xmonkey-namonica) is a Python tool created to 
facilitate the generation of Open Source Legal Notices, which 
contain copyright and license information from Open Source packages. 
The main goal of the tool is to provide a tool for developers to 
programmatically generate legal notices for the open-source 
software shipped in their projects, with fewer requirements 
and no friction.

The tool uses a few other Xmonkey libraries under the hood, 
for example:

* Lidy: LiDY - Simplified License Identification Library.
