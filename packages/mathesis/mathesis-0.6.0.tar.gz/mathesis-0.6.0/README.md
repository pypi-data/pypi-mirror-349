[Mathesis](//github.com/ozekik/mathesis) is a human-friendly Python library for computational formal logic (including mathematical, symbolic, philosophical logic), formal semantics, and theorem proving.
It is particularly well-suited for:

- Students learning logic and educators teaching it
- Researchers in fields like logic, philosophy, linguistics, computer science, and many others

**Documentation:** <https://ozekik.github.io/mathesis/>

## Installation

```bash
pip install mathesis
```

## Key features

- Interactive theorem proving for humans (proof assistant)
- Automated reasoning (theorem prover)
- Define models and check validity of inferences in the models
- JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebook support
- Output formulas/proofs in LaTeX
- Customizable ASCII/Unicode syntax (like `A -> B`, `A → B`, `A ⊃ B` for the conditional)

## Supported logics

### Propositional logics

|   | Truth Table | Tableau | Natural Deduction | Sequent Calculus |
|---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Classical logic | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Many-valued logics | ✅ | - | - | - |
| Intuitionistic logic | n/a | - | - | ✅ |

#### In Progress

- Modal logics
- Fuzzy logics
- Substructural logics
- Epistemic, doxastic, deontic logics
- Temporal logics

### First-order logics (quantified, predicate logics)

|   | Model | Tableau | Natural Deduction | Sequent Calculus |
|---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Classical logic | ✅ | ✅ | - | - |

#### In Progress

- Many-valued logics
- Modal logics
- Intuitionistic logic
- Fuzzy logics
- Substructural logics
- Higher-order logics
