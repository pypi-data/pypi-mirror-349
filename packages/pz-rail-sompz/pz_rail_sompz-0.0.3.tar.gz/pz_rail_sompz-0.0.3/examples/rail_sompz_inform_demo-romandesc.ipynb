    "This notebook will demonstrate the training of the \"deep\" and \"wide\" Self-Organized Maps (SOMs) used by `rail_sompz`.  `rail_sompz` is a ported version of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) SOM-based tomographic redshift bin software.\n",

    "Like other RAIL estimators and summarizers, `rail_sompz` consists of an informer stage and an estimator stage, in this case `SOMPZInformer` and `SOMPZEstimator`.  `SOMPZInformer` takes in a dataset and builds a SOM using that data.  We will need to build two SOMs for sompz, one using \"deep\" data (usually over a smaller area and with additional observed data, e.g. near-infrared bands), and a second SOM trained on \"wide\" data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of **configuration parameters** that the stage uses to control aspects of the SOM training:\n",
    "- redshift_col: the name of the redshift column\n",
    "- hdf5_groupname: the hdf5_groupname for data\n",
    "- inputs: the list of the names of columns to be used as inputs for the data\n",
    "- input_errs: the list of the names of columns containing errors on inputs for the data\n",
    "- zero_points: the list of zero points for converting mags to fluxes for the data, if needed\n",
    "- som_shape: a tuple defining the shape for the som, must be a 2-element tuple, e.g. `(32, 32)`\n",
    "- som_minerror: the floor value placed on observational error on each feature in the som\n",
    "- som_wrap: boolean flag to set whether the SOM has periodic boundary conditions\n",
    "- som_take_log: boolean flag to set whether to take log of inputs (i.e. for fluxes) for the som\n",
    "- convert_to_flux: boolean flag for whether to convert input columns to fluxes for the data, set to true if inputs are mags and to False if inputs are already fluxes\n",
    "- set_threshold: boolean flag for whether to replace values below a threshold with a set number\n",
    "- thresh_val_deep: threshold value for set_threshold for the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will set several of these values in our example, any values not explicitly set will revert to their defaults.  \n",
    "\n",

    "Next, let's read in some test data. We'll use some small datasets drawn from the Roman-DESC simulations, and where we have incorporated expected 10-year depth photometric uncertainties into the data via the photerr-based error models in RAIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOMPZ method usually leverages a \"deep\" dataset with extra bands (often in the near-infrared), where the extra photometric information in the extended wavelength coverage enables a magnitudes/colors -> redshift mapping with less degeneracies than when using optical colors along.  For this demo, we will use data from the Rubin-Roman simulation [Citation needed!], which does contain simluated photometry for both the Rubin optical `ugrizy` bands as well as the Roman `JHFK` bands.  The Roman `J`, `H`, `F`, and `K` bands have central wavelengths of approximately 1.29, 1.58, 1.84, and 2.13 microns respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have prepared several data files consisting of simulated Roman-DESC data, the cell below contains (commented) commands to fetch those files from NERSC.  There are two sets of files included in the tar file, one set contains 37,500 \"specz\" galaxies (which are a subset of a set of 75,000 \"deep/balrog\" galaxies, and a set of 100,000 \"wide field\" galaxies.  The other set consists of a subset of these galaxies where we only take 5% of each of the larger samples (so 1875 specz, 3750 \"deep\", and 5000 \"wide\" galaxies.  The larger files will give a more robust mapping in our SOM given the extra training data, but will take longer.  The smaller files will give results that do not look as nice, but are large enough to showcase the method while running much faster.  You can comment or uncomment the three files in the cells below to switch from the \"small\" files to the \"large\" files if you do not mind some extra run time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the \"deep\" SOM, the data file is named `romandesc_deep_data_37c_noinf.hdf5` and includes the LSST `ugrizy` bands as well as the Roman `JHF` bands (we leave off the K-band for simplicity), for a total of **nine** bands.  The extra near-infrared information in the `JHF` bands will be crucial in mapping out the color to redshift relation for our deep sample.   The galaxies in this file are trimmed to include only galaxies with i<25.0.  This sample size is smaller than those that we will typically use, but enough for a functional example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the \"wide\" som, the data file is named `romandesc_wide_data_50c_noinf.hdf5` and we will only use the `ugrizy` bands in the analysis.  There are 5000 galaxies in this file.\n",

We'll feed in a list for the zero points (`zero_points`) as well.  We want to convert to flux so we set `convert_to_flux_deep` and `convert_to_flux_wide` to `True`.  We will also apply a threshold cut to the deep SOM by setting `set_threshold_deep` to `True` and set the threshold value with `thresh_val_deep` = 1.e-5.  We can set the shape of the SOMs or let them take their default values.  Let's leave the \"deep\" SOM with its default size of `(32, 32)` by not supplying a value, and change the \"wide\" SOM size with `som_shape_wide=(25,25)`.  If your input data is flux-like (which ours is not) and want it to look more magnitude-like, you can set  `som_take_log_wide` to `True` if you want to take the log of the data before creating the SOM.  We will set this to `False`, as we want to work in converted flux space.
