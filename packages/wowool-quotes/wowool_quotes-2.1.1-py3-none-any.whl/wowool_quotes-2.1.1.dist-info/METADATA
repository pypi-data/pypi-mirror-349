# Extracting quotes and their referenced entities

The quotes app extracts quotations, even when the quotes extend through several sentences of text. 

<note>The app performs a lookup when a `QuotationScope` entity is found, that encompasses the `Quotation` and the `QuotationAuthor`. You can find this in the `quotation` domain or you can make your own custom domain with this entity.</note>

## Options

#### QuotesOptions

```typescript
interface QuotesOptions {
    mentions: string[];
}
```

with:

# API

## Examples

You will need to install the english language module to run the sample. `pip install wowool-english` 

### Extracting sentiments

Note that in the results the sentiments have been resolved. For this to happen we need to add the entities in the pipeline.



```python
from wowool.sdk import Pipeline
from wowool.quotes import Quotes

text = '"Wowool has cool technology", said John Smith.'
pipeline = Pipeline(
    [
        "english",
        "quotation",
        "quotes.app",
    ]
)
document = pipeline(text)
print(document.results(Quotes.ID))

```

results:

```json
[
    {
        "text": "\"Wowool has cool technology\"",
        "begin_offset": 0,
        "end_offset": 28,
        "author": "John Smith"
    }
]
```
