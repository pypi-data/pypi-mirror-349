- ⚗️ updated schema to support defining columns with a dictionary or kwargs (fixes #4)
- 🧼 updated `CleanEnumColumn` to handle null and invalid value (fixes #16 and #17)
- 🐛 updated `TableSchema.process_data` to not return validated lazyframe when validate stage fails (fixes #15)
- ⚗️ updated `ref` & `col` constructors to allows definitions using both a call pattern ( `z.col("demo")` ) and as a
  direct attribute ( `z.col.demo` )
- 🔧 added `parse_column_name` function to parse a column name into a `ColumnRef`

## [0.1.3] - 2025-05-15

### What's Changed

- ⚗️ removed `with_stage` from TableSchema (introduced on 0.1.2) - stage should not be changed after initialisation
- ♻️ refactored to support better public submodule exports - `zeolite.ref` and `zeolite.types` are now public
- 🧼 added alias for `float`/`decimal`/`integer` cleaning

## [0.1.2] - 2025-05-14

### What's Changed

- 🐛 fixed bug with extract_base_name not handling prefixes properly

- ⚗️ added `required` and `with_stage` setter functions to TableSchema

## [0.1.1] - 2025-05-13

### What's Changed

- ⚗️ updated normalisation to sanitise both the data source columns and the alias columns from the schema to make sure
  the match is clean. This also lets us go straight from source -> sanitised in one rename step
- ⚗️ updated TableSchema to check for alias conflicts
- 🔧 updated sanitisation functions with better edge case handling

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-06

  processing/validation of datasets
- 💎 Added validation check functions for `check_is_value_empty`, `check_is_value_duplicated`,
  `check_is_value_invalid_date` and `check_is_value_equal_to`
- 🗃️ Added internal `ColumnRegistry` to manage column definitions, lineage, etc
- 🔧 Added `ref`/`ColumnRef` helper to create name/id references to other columns
