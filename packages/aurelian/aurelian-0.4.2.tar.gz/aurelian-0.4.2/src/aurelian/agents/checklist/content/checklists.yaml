    title: Standards for Technical Reporting in Environmental and host-Associated Microbiome Studies (STREAMS) guidelines
    keywords: [Environmental microbiome]
    description: Data and knowledge sharing in microbiome research presents unique challenges owing to the interdisciplinary nature of the field coupled with the generation of complex multi-omics data. For human microbiome research, the Strengthening the Organization and Reporting of Microbiome Studies (STORMS) reporting guidelines are an effective checklist for the organization of necessary study, experimental design, and analytical methods within a scientific manuscript. Here, we expand upon the STORMS reporting guidelines to include environmental, non-human host-associated, and synthetic microbiomes. The Standards for Technical Reporting in Environmental and host-Associated Microbiome Studies (STREAMS) guidelines are a consensus from input received from nearly 250 researchers spanning 30 countries. The STREAMS guidelines include 18 items organized to support the reporting of microbiome studies in a robust, standardized, and machine-actionable manner. We provide detailed guidance on each section and comparison with STORMS, along with example case studies that demonstrate the usage of STREAMS. Additional implementations of the STREAMS guidelines are found in the accompanying DMPTool templates, along with information on available scientific journals that encourage usage when publishing. Future efforts to update STREAMS versions and coordination with the STORMS consortium will follow best practices in building community consensus.
