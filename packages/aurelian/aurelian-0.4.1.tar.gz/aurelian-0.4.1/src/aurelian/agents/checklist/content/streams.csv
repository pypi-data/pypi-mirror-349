Photos of the environments, samples, or methodologies can provide important context and can be added to main text or supplemental figures. Visualizations should be easily interpretable and colorblind-friendly. The caption, main text, or supplementary information should provide enough of a description of the visualizations for visually-impaired readers to interpret findings.

Definitions may also need to be provided in the Introduction or Methods if they are directly used in hypotheses or research questions.

When interpreting the findings, consider how the interpretation of the findings may be summarized or quoted for the general public such as in press releases or news articles.

If causal language is used in the interpretation (such as ""alters,"" ""affects,"" ""results in,"" ""causes,"" or ""impacts""), assumptions made for causal inference should be explicitly stated.
