    "# Basic Usage of reLAISS\n",
    "### Authors: Evan Reynolds and Alex Gagliano\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "reLAISS is the second version of LAISS (Lightcurve Anomaly Identification & Similarity Search); a tool to find similar supernovae & identify anomalous supernovae (and the galaxies that host them) using their photometric features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity search takes advantage of [Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah (ANNOY)](https://github.com/spotify/annoy), the approximate nearest neighbors algorithm developed by Spotify that allows you to come up with a relevant song to listen to before your current one ends. The anomaly detection classifier is an isolation forest model trained on a dataset bank of over 22,000 transients.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the basic features of the reLAISS library for finding similar astronomical transients.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topics Covered\n",
    "1. Initializing the ReLAISS client\n",
