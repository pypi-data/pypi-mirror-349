Naming convention for research artefacts
----------------------------------------

Scientists and engineer create a multitude of digital artefacts during their daily work:
    - experimental results,
    - simulation results,
    - literate programming notebooks analysing experiments and simulations
    - statistical models,
    - machine learning models,
    - figures,
    - tables, etc

In order to trace and track these multiple interconnected research artefacts, hierarchical naming schemes
are a powerful tool to document the connection between research artefacts, find previous research outputs, and enable
reproducible research [1].

The following naming scheme has evolved over several years to track research artefacts of all kinds.

The general scheme is: ``DSyymd[hMM]e[_x]__title``

-   ``DS``: Project specific initials. Here, `DS` stands for *Data Science*.
-   ``yy``: [0-9][0-9] are the last two digits of the years in the 21st century. I won't live beyond that. So, I do not care for following centuries.
-   ``m``: [o-z] these letters map to the respective months.
-   ``d``: [1-9,A-V] represent the 31 days of a month. Digits and upper-case characters have approximately the same height, such that this element gives a visual structure to the name, which divides the date from the daily counter.
-   ``h``: [a-x] these optional letters refer to the hours of the day
-   ``MM``: [0-5][0-9] are the minutes with 00 encoding the full hour
-   ``e``: [a-z]+ daily counter as lower-case letter enumerating the respective database or dataset. The 28th dataset would start with be enumerated as `aa`.
-   ``x``: Optional attribute being the last significant characters of the dataset, from which `DSyymde` is derived.
-   ``title``: Readable name of the respective data set with whitespaces being replaced by underscores.

- The first dataset created on Friday 01.01.2021 would be named `DS21o1a`.
- The second dataset created on the same day would be named `DS21o1b`.
- An analysis (e.g. Jupyter notebook) of the first data set started after the second data set had been created would be named `DS21o1c_a`. Exported figures of this analysis should be named `DS21o1c_a__[plottype].[filetype]`.
- An analysis of data set `DS21o1b` started on 2nd January should be named `DS21o2a_1b`.
- An meta analysis of `DS21o1c_a` and `DS21o2a_1b` started on 11th February should be named `DS21pBa_o1c_2a`.

Installation
============
The module ``contexere`` can be installed from PyPi::

    pip install contexere

Usage
=====
The project provides the command line tool ``name``::

    usage: name [-h] [--version] [-n] [-p PROJECT] [-s] [-t] [-v] [-vv] [path]

    Suggest name for research artefact
    
    positional arguments:
      path                  Path to folder with research artefacts (default:
                            current working dir)
    
    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      -n, --next            Suggest next artefact name
      -p PROJECT, --project PROJECT
                            Specify project abbreviation
      -s, --summary         Sumarize files following the naming convention
      -t, --time            add time abbreviation
      -u, --utc             Generate timestamp with respect to UTC (default is local timezone)
      -v, --verbose         set loglevel to INFO
      -vv, --very-verbose   set loglevel to DEBUG

Calling the tool without any arguments returns the date abbreviation of today::

    name
    24xV

Adding the option ``--time`` also abbreviates the actual time::

    name --time
    24xVj36

In an empty folder, a file name is suggested by specifying a project abbreviation and the ``--next`` option::

    mkdir test_folder
    cd test_folder
    name --project DS --next
    DS24xVa

After the creation of the first file, only the ``--next`` option needs to be provided to get another file name suggestion::

    touch DS24xVa__test.dat
    name --next
    DS24xVb

Let's assume that ``DS24xVb`` is the name of a Jupyter notebook, which analyses results created by ``DS24xVa.py``. You can reflect this relation by actually naming the notebook ``DS24xVb_xVa__anlysis.ipynb`` to reflect its relation to ``DS24xVa.py``. However, simplifying the name by removing redundant elements of the reference ``DS24xVb_a__anlysis.ipynb`` is even more efficient.
