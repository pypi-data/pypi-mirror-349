            assistant> They used a combination of theoretical models and observational data to establish the criteria for classifying galaxies as active or star-forming.
            user> so they used a priori knowledge to determine the classification of the galaxies?
            assistant> Yes, they relied on existing knowledge and models to classify the galaxies based on their emission line ratios.
            
        You might extract the following lessons learned:
            -The user had difficulty understanding how emission line ratios could be 
            used for galaxies without any other known signal of black hole accretion,
            and the assistant helped them understand that the classification of galaxies

            user> but what if i don't use volumes or bind mounts?

            user> so i need to use volumes or bind mounts to keep the data?
            assistant> Yes, using volumes or bind mounts is necessary to ensure data persistence in Docker containers.
        You might extract the following lessons learned:
            - The user was unsure about the data persistence in Docker containers and
            asked the assistant for clarification, learning that Docker containers can
            store data permanently only if volumes or bind mounts are used.

    If an individual's functional relationship is essentially idempotent to an existing individual,

    then the new individual is not a new individual and their information should be associated with the existing individual.
     Another example is if a new individual is "one of my best friends" and there is an existing "best friend" identifier,
     then without an associated name it is best to associate that individual with the generalized class of "best friend" rather than
     trying to keep track of multiple individual best friends.
     
     An example which would not be idempotent is if a new individual is "my best friend John" and there is an existing "best friend" identifier.
