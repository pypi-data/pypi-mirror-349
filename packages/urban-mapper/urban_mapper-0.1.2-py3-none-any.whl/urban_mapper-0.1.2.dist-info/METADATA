> [!IMPORTANT]
> - 📣 `UrbanMapper` is on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/urban-mapper/)!
> - 🚀 Documentation is out ! Check it out [here](https://urbanmapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
> - 🤝 We support [JupyterGIS](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis) following one of your `Urban Pipeline`'s analysis for collaborative in real-time exploration on Jupyter 🏂 Shout-out to [@mfisher87](https://github.com/mfisher87) and `JGIS` team for their tremendous help.

## 🌆 UrbanMapper –– In a Nutshell

`UrbanMapper` –– `f(.)` –– brings urban layers (e.g. `Street Roads` / `Intersections` or `Sidewalks` / `Cross Walks`) ––
`X` ––
and your urban datasets –– `Y` –– together through the function *f(X, Y) = X ⋈ Y*, allowing you to spatial-join
these components, and enrich `X` given `Y` attributes, features and information.

While `UrbanMapper` is built with a **Scikit-Learn-like philosophy** – i.e., (I) from `loading` to `viz.` passing by
`mapping` and `enriching`, we want to cover as much as users’ wishes in a welcoming way without having to code 20+/50+
lines of code for one, ~~non-reproducible, non-shareable, non-updatable piece of code;~~ and (II) the library’s
flexibility allows for easy
contributions to sub-modules without having to start from scratch _“all the time”_.

This means that `UrbanMapper` is allowing you to build a reproducible, shareable, and updatable urban pipeline in a
few lines of code 🎉 This could therefore be seen as a stepping-stone / accelerator to further analysis such as machine
learning-based ones.

The only thing we request from you is to be sure that your datasets `Y` are spatial datasets (i.e. with latitude and
longitude coordinates) and let's
urban proceed with enriching your urban layer of interests from **insights**  your _datasets_ comes with.

## 🥐 Installation

Install `UrbanMapper` via ``pip`` (works in any environment):
 ```bash
 pip install urban-mapper
 ```
Then launch Jupyter Lab to explore `UrbanMapper`:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

> [!TIP]
> We recommend installing `UrbanMapper` in a virtual environment to keep things tidy and avoid dependency conflicts. You can find detailed instructions—including how to install within a virtual environment using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) or from source—
in the [UrbanMapper Installation Guide](https://urbanmapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation/).

# 🗺️ Urban Layers Currently Supported

`UrbanMapper` currently supports the following urban layers:

1) **Streets Roads** –– `UrbanMapper` can load street road networks from `OpenStreetMap` (OSM) using `OSMNx`.
2) **Streets Intersections** –– `UrbanMapper` can load street intersections from `OpenStreetMap` (OSM) using `OSMNx`.
3) **Sidewalks** –– `UrbanMapper` can load sidewalk via `Tile2Net` using Deep Learning for automated mapping of
   pedestrian infrastructure from aerial imagery.
4) **Cross Walks** –– `UrbanMapper` can load crosswalk via `Tile2Net` using Deep Learning for automated mapping of
   pedestrian infrastructure from aerial imagery.
5) **Cities' Features** -- `Urban Mapper` can load OSM cities features such as buildings, parks, Bike Lanes etc. via
   `OSMNx` API.
6) **Region Neighborhoods** –– `UrbanMapper` can load neighborhoods boundaries from `OpenStreetMap` (OSM) using `OSMNx` Features
   module.
7) **Region Cities** –– `UrbanMapper` can load cities boundaries from `OpenStreetMap` (OSM) using `OSMNx` Features module.
8) **Region States** –– `UrbanMapper` can load states boundaries from `OpenStreetMap` (OSM) using `OSMNx` Features module.
9) **Region Countries** –– `UrbanMapper` can load countries boundaries from `OpenStreetMap` (OSM) using `OSMNx`
   Features module.

More will be added in the future, e.g `Subway`/`Tube` networks, etc. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to
open an issue or a pull request on our GitHub repository.

# 🚀 Getting Started with UrbanMapper

Are you ready to dive into urban data analysis? The simplest approach to get started with `UrbanMapper` is to look
through the two getting-started examples available in the documentation then walk through the hands-on examples in the 
`examples/` directory. These **Jupyter notebooks** walk you through the library's features, from `loading` and 
`prepping data` to `enriching` urban layers and `visualising` the results. 

Documentation is available at [UrbanMapper Documentation](https://urbanmapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
