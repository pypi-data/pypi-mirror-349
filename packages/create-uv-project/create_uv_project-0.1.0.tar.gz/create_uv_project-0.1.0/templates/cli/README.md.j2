# {{ project_name }} (CLI)

`{{ project_name }}` is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application built with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), generated by `create-uv-project`.

## Description

{{ project_description | default("A powerful and user-friendly CLI application.") }}

## Features

- Modern CLI development with Typer.
- Rich terminal output (colors, progress bars, etc.) via `rich` (included with `typer[all]`)
- `src`-layout structure.
- Pre-configured with Black, Ruff, and Pytest.
- Ready for `uv`!

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    # git clone ...
    # cd {{ project_slug }}
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment using `uv`:**
    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies (including development and test tools):**
    ```bash
    uv pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
    ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the CLI application directly:

```bash
{{ project_slug }} [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] [ARGS]
```

For example, to see help information:

```bash
{{ project_slug }} --help
```

To run a specific command (if you have subcommands like `example`):
```bash
{{ project_slug }} example --name YourName
```

## Development

### Running the CLI directly from source (for development)

You can run the CLI using `uv run` for development purposes without installing it globally:

```bash
# Example: Show help
uv run {{ project_slug }} --help

# Example: Run a command
uv run {{ project_slug }} example --name Developer
```

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

Or with `uv`:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

To get a coverage report:

```bash
uv run pytest --cov
```

### Code Quality

- **Format code with Black:**
  ```bash
  uv run black src tests
  ```

- **Lint with Ruff:**
  ```bash
  uv run ruff check src tests
  ```

## Project Structure

- `src/{{ project_slug }}/cli.py`: Main Typer application and command definitions.
- `src/{{ project_slug }}/commands/`: (Optional) Module for organizing subcommands.
- `tests/`: Test files, potentially using Typer's `CliRunner` or similar.
