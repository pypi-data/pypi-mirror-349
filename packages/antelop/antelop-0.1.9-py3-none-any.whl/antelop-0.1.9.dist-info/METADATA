# Antelop
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Antelop is a complete data processing and management tool for systems neuroscientists.

It allows you to easily adopt modern data engineering infrastructures and efficient data preprocessing pipelines in a simple graphical application. It also provides a host of visualisation tools and a standard library of common analysis functions, as well as a framework for you to write your own fully reproducable analysis functions.

At present, Antelop supports electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and behavioural data.

To learn more about Antelop, please read our [documentation](https://antelop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation

The terminal interface of Antelop can be installed via pip. Note that Antelop requires python 3.9:

```python
pip install antelop
```

To minimise installation time, a number of features are offered as optional dependencies.

```python
pip install antelop[gui] # For our graphical user interface

pip install antelop[gui, phy] # For electrophysiology manual curation

pip install antelop[gui, dlc] # For deeplabcut subject pose estimation

pip install antelop[full] # For everything (longer installation time)
```

Conda users can get started as follows:

```python
conda create -n antelop python=3.9
conda activate antelop
pip install antelop
```

## Usage

To run the gui:

```python
antelop
```

*Antelop user interface*

You will be prompted for your database login credentials.

To run the IPython console interface:

```python
antelop-python
```

To use Antelop in a script, set the `$DB_USER` and `$DB_PASS` environment variables, then import all the tables and analysis functions as follows:

```python
from antelop.load_connection import *
```
