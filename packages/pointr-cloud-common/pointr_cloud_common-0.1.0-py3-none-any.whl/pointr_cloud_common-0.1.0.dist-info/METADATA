### Key Components

#### API Services

The library is organized into several services, each responsible for a specific area of functionality:

- **V9ApiService**: The main service for V9 API that provides access to all other V9 services. It handles authentication and API requests.
- **SiteApiService**: Service for site-related API operations.
- **BuildingApiService**: Service for building-related API operations.
- **LevelApiService**: Service for level-related API operations.
- **ClientApiService**: Service for client-related API operations.
- **SdkApiService**: Service for SDK configuration-related API operations.

#### Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

DTOs are used to represent data structures:

- **SiteDTO**: Represents a site
- **BuildingDTO**: Represents a building
- **LevelDTO**: Represents a level
- **ClientMetadataDTO**: Represents client metadata
- **SdkConfigurationDTO**: Represents an SDK configuration
- **CreateResponseDTO**: Represents a create response
- **GpsGeofenceDTO**: Represents a GPS geofence

### Testing

The library uses pytest for testing. To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=pointr_cloud_common
```

To generate a coverage report:

```bash
pytest --cov=pointr_cloud_common --cov-report=html
```

### Adding New Features

1. **Create a new branch**:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Implement your changes**:

   - Add new services in the appropriate `api/` directory
   - Add new DTOs in the appropriate `dto/` directory
   - Add utility functions in the `utils/` directory
   - Add helper functions in the `helpers/` directory

3. **Add tests**:

   - Add unit tests in the `tests/` directory
   - Ensure all new code is covered by tests

This project follows the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. We recommend using tools like `flake8` and `black` to ensure code quality:

```bash
# Check code style
flake8 src tests

# Format code
black src tests
```
