 Usage
*******

To use this module, you need to go to Settings -> Technical ->
Translations and activate the languages you want to translate the
document.page model into. Then, go to Knowledge -> Documents -> Pages
and edit or create a new page. You will see the option to translate the
name and content fields in each language activated. Remember to leave
all the valid translations in `translated` status so that it will be
used by Odoo as an actual translation. Otherwise some features like APIs
won't work for searching in those languages.
