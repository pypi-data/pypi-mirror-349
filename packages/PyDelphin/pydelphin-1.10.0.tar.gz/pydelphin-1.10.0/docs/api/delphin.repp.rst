delphin.repp
============

.. automodule:: delphin.repp

   A Regular-Expression Preprocessor [REPP]_ is a method of applying a
   system of regular expressions for transformation and tokenization
   while retaining character indices from the original input string.

	     experiment, recommendations, and toolkit. In Proceedings

.. note::

   Requires ``regex`` (https://bitbucket.org/mrabarnett/mrab-regex/),
   for advanced regular expression features such as group-local inline
   flags. Without it, PyDelphin will fall back to the :py:mod:`re`
   module in the standard library which may give some unexpected
   results. The ``regex`` library, however, will not parse unescaped
   brackets in character classes without resorting to a compatibility
   mode (see `this issue`_ for the ERG), and PyDelphin will warn if
   this happens. The ``regex`` dependency is satisfied if you install
   PyDelphin with the ``[repp]`` extra (see :doc:`../guides/setup`).
