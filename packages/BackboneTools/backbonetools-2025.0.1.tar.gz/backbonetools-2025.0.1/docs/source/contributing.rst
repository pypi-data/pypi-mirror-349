For new features, add a new branch to the git repository (https://gitlab.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ee/backbonetools).
If you are no member of the Ruhr University Bochum, you can sign up as an external person.
Add your feature to your branch.
Remember to add docstrings to all classes and methods similar to the existing docstrings (if you are using visual studio code, you can create an automated template when the extension "autoDocstring - Python Docstring Generator" is installed by pressing Ctrl+Shift+2 below the function/class name).
If you finished developing, create a merge request and wait for approval by the maintainer team.
