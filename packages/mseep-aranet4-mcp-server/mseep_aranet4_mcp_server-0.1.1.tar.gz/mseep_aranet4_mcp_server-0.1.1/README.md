# aranet4-mcp-server

MCP server to manage your Aranet4 CO2 sensor. Built upon [Aranet4-Python](https://github.com/Anrijs/Aranet4-Python).

> [!TIP]
> For the standalone python version without MCP logic, see [aranet4-archiver](https://github.com/diegobit/aranet4-archiver?tab=readme-ov-file).

## Features:
- Scan for nearby devices.
- Fetch new data from embedded device memory and save to a local sqlite db for tracking and later viewing. For automatic updates, see at the bottom.
- Ask questions about recent measurements or about a specific past date.
- *[For MCP clients that support images]* Ask data to be plotted to also have a nice visualization!
- **Assisted configuration!** ðŸ’« After installation, just ask `init aranet4` in your client to set up everything for the mcp server to work with your device.

## Installation

1. Clone repo:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:diegobit/aranet4-mcp-server.git`
    cd aranet4-mcp-server
    ```

2. Prepare environment:

    - **Recommended (with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))**: Nothing to do. The provided `pyproject.toml` handles dependencied and virtual environments.
    - **Alternative (with pip)**: install with `pip install .`

3. Add to MCP client configuration:

    ```json
    "aranet4": {
      "command": "{{PATH_TO_UV}}", // run `which uv`
        "args": [
          "--directory",
          "{{PATH_TO_SRC}}/aranet4-mcp-server/",
          "run",
          "src/server.py"
        ]
    }
    ```

    - Claude Desktop MacOS config file path: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    - Cursor MacOS config file path: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

4. Configure:

    - **Recommended (AI assisted config!):** start your client and ask `init aranet4` to get a guided configuration.
    - **Alternative (manual):** edit file `config.yaml`. You need to provide the mac address and the device name. You can get the mac address with `aranetctl --scan` from [Aranet4-Python](https://github.com/Anrijs/Aranet4-Python) (installed with this repo dependencies).

## Dockerfile

Dockerfile is available. Remember to pass env variables or update `config.yaml`.

## List of tools

**Configuration and utils**:
- `init_aranet4_config`: assisted configuration of device.
- `scan_devices`: scan nearby bluetooth aranet4 devices.
- `get_configuration_and_db_stats`: get current config.yaml and general stats from the local sqlite3 db.
- `set_configuration`: set values in config.yaml.

**To update historical data**:
- `fetch_new_data`: fetch new data from configured nearby aranet4 device and save to local db.

**To query historical data**:
- `get_recent_data`: get recent data from local db. Can specify how many measurements. 
- `get_data_by_timerange`: get data in specific timerange from local db. Can specify how many measurements (careful, if the range is big and the limit is low, datapoints will be skipped).

  For both, ask to receive a plot to have it generated and displayed.

## Automatic data fetch job

If you want your local db to always be updated, you can setup a cronjob or a launch agent that fetches data automatically every few hours. In MacOS, do as follows:

1. Configure absolute paths in `com.diegobit.aranet4-fetch.plist`.
2. Install LaunchAgent:
   ```bash
   cp com.diegobit.aranet4-fetch.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.diegobit.aranet4-fetch.plist
   ```

For other platforms, just run `fetch-job.py` periodically however you prefer.
