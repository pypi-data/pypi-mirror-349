# Rasvec

This is a Python library designed to streamline the handling of geospatial data, particularly for machine learning applications. Working with geospatial datasets often involves challenges like rasterization, vectorization, and grid creationâ€”this library provides efficient and easy-to-use functions to simplify these processes.

- Documentation : https://rasvec.readthedocs.io

## Features

### vectors

- `clip_vector_by_raster`
- `create_grid_on_vector`
- `rasterize`

### rasters

- `patchify` (divides the raster into geotagged patches)
- `vectorization`

### satellite imagery

- `tms_to_geotiff` 

### view

- `view_rasters`

## Example

Here's an example of a feature: Generating a grid over a vector file.


```python
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from rasvec import create_grid_on_vector

gdf = gpd.read_file(r"sample_data/vector/vec/vec.shp")

# 
grid_cells = create_grid_on_vector("sample_data/vector/vec/vec.shp", 1000, "grid.shp")

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(10, 10))
gdf.plot(ax=ax[0])
ax[0].set_title("Original Vector Data")
gdf.plot(ax=ax[1])
grid_cells.plot(ax=ax[1], facecolor="none", edgecolor="red")
ax[1].set_title("Vector Data with Grid Overlay")
ax[0].axis("off")
ax[1].axis("off")
plt.tight_layout()

```
The output:
