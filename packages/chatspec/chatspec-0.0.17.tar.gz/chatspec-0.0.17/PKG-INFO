           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.

              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity

              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install chatspec
```

#  📚 Documentation & Examples

`chatspec` provides a 'prethora' (as many as would actually be useful) of types, models & methods for validating, converting and augmenting objects used in the OpenAI chat completions API specification, as well as a `MockAI` client & `mock_completion()` method for creating mock llm responses quickly. I use [Instructor](https://github.com/instructor-ai/instructor) for all of my structured outputs, so `Pydantic` is a core part of this library. The point of this library is to provide a common interface for methods that I have found myself needing to replicate across multiple projects.

## ✨ Quickstart

```python
# just import the package
import chatspec

# create some tool for the llm to call
def get_capital(city : str) -> str:
    return "Paris"

# create a mock completion with a simulated tool call & stream it!
stream = chatspec.mock_completion(
    # format threads easily
    # this creates a proper list of messages from a:
    # - string
    # - list of messages
    # - single message (pydantic or dict)
    messages = chatspec.normalize_messages("What is the capital of France?"),
    # convert python functions / pydantic models / and more to tools easily
    tools = [chatspec.convert_to_tool(get_capital)],
    # streaming is supported & properly typed / handled
    stream = True
)

# chatspec provides a plethora of 'ease of use' methods
chatspec.print_stream(stream)
# >>> Mock response to: What is the capital of France?
# >>> Tool Call:
# >>>   ID: 79d46439-3df2-49de-b978-8be0ef54dccf
# >>>   Type: function
# >>>   Function: get_capital
# >>>   Arguments: {"city": "mock_string"}
```

## 🥸 Mock Completions

`chatspec` provides both `async` & `synchronous` mock completion methods with support for streaming,
simulated tool calls, all with proper typing and overloading for response types.

```python
# create a mock streamed completion
stream = mock_completion(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}],
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    stream=True,
)
# chatspec provides a helper method to easily print streams
# everything is typed & overloaded properly for streamed & non-streamed responses
# its like its a real client!
chatspec.print_stream(stream)
# >>> Mock response to: Hello, how are you?

# you can also simulate tool calls
# this also works both for streamed & non-streamed responses
mock_completion(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
    ],
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "get_capital",
                "description": "Get the capital of France",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "city": {"type": "string"}
                    }
                },
            },
        }
    ],

## 💬 Chat Messages

`chatspec` provides a variety of utility when working with `Message` objects. These methods can be used for validation, conversion, creation of 
specific message types & more.

#### Instance Checking & Validation of `Messages`

```python
import chatspec

# easily check if an object is a valid message
chatspec.is_message(
    {
        "role" : "assistant",
        "content" : "Hello, how are you?",
        "tool_calls" : [
            {
                "id" : "123",
                "function" : {"name" : "my_function", "arguments" : "{}"}
            }
        ]
    }
)
# >>> True

chatspec.is_message(
    # 'context' key is invalid
    {"role": "user", "context": "Hello, how are you?"}
)
# >>> False
```

#### Validation & Normalization of `Messages` & `System Prompts`

```python
import chatspec

# easily validate & normalize into chat message threads
chatspec.normalize_messages("Hello!")
# >>> [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
chatspec.normalize_messages({
    "role" : "system",
    "content" : "You are a helpful assistant."
})
# >>> [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}]

# use the `normalize_system_prompt` method to 'normalize' a thread for use with a singular system
# prompt.
# this method automatically formats the entire thread so the system prompt is always the first message.
chatspec.normalize_system_prompt(
    [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"}
    ],
    system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant."
)
# >>> [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"}]

chatspec.normalize_system_prompt(
    [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"},
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful"},
        {"role": "system", "content": "assistant."}
    ],
)
# >>> [[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful\nassistant.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello!'}]
```

#### Convert or Create Specific `Message` Types

Using one of the various `create_*_message` methods, you can easily convert to or create specific `Message` types.

```python
import chatspec

# create a tool message from a completion response
# and a function's output
chatspec.create_tool_message()

# create a message with image content
chatspec.create_image_message()

# create a message with input audio content
chatspec.create_input_audio_message()
```

## 🔧 Tools & Tool Calling

#### Instance Checking & Validation of `Tools`

Same as the `Message` types, tools can be validated using the `is_tool` method.

```python
import chatspec

my_tool = {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "my_function",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "url": {
                    "type": "string",

                }
            }
        }
    }
}

chatspec.is_tool(my_tool)
# >>> True

chatspec.is_tool({})
# >>> False
```

#### Convert `Python Functions`, `Pydantic Models`, `Dataclasses` & more to `Tools`

```python
import chatspec

# you can be super minimal
def my_tool(x : str) -> str:
    return x

chatspec.convert_to_tool(my_tool)
# >>> {
#     "type": "function",
#     "function": {
#         "name": "my_tool",
#         "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"x": {"type": "string"}}}
#     }
# }

# or fully define docstrings/annotations
def my_tool(x : str) -> str:
    """
    A tool with some glorious purpose.

    Args:
        x (str): The input to the tool.

    Returns:
        str: The output of the tool.
    """
    return x

chatspec.convert_to_tool(my_tool)
# >>> {
#     'type': 'function',
#     'function': {
#         'name': 'my_tool',
#        'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'x': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The input to the tool.'}}, 'required': ['x'], 'additionalProperties': False},
#        'description': 'A tool with some glorious purpose.\n',
#        'returns': 'The output of the tool.'
#    }
# }
```

#### Interacting with `Tool Calls` in `Completions` & Executing `Tools`

```python
import chatspec

# easily check if a completion or stream has a tool call
chatspec.has_tool_call()

# get the tool calls from a completion or a stream
chatspec.get_tool_calls(completion)

# run a tool using a completion response
# this will only run the function if the tool call was present in the completion
chatspec.run_tool(completion, my_tool)

# create a tool message from a completion response
# and a function's output
chatspec.create_tool_message(completion, my_tool_output)
```

## ✨ Completion Responses & Streams

#### Instance Checking & Validation of `Completions` & `Streams`

```python
import chatspec

# check if an object is a valid chat completion or stream
chatspec.is_completion(completion)

# check if an object is a valid stream
chatspec.is_stream(stream)
```

#### The `Stream Passthrough` & `Stream` Specific Methods

`chatspec` provides an internal system for caching & storing stream responses from chat completions, for use & reuse for any of the methods
within this library for streams. This is helpful, as the user is able to send/display the initial stream response to the client, while still
being able to use it internally for any other use case.

```python
import chatspec
# `openai` is not included in the package, so you'll need to install it separately
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# run the stream through the passthrough
stream = chatspec.stream_passthrough(client.chat.completions.create(
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}],
    model = "gpt-4o-mini",
    stream = True,
))

# print the stream
chatspec.is_stream(stream)
# >>> True

# run any number of other methods over the stream
chatspec.dump_stream_to_message(stream)
# >>> {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! I'm just a program, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here and ready to help you. How can I 
# >>> assist you today?"}

# chatspec.dump_stream_to_completion(stream)
# chatspec.is_completion(stream)
# chatspec.print_stream(stream)
```

## 🆉 Types & Parameters

Use any of the provided types & models for schema reference, as well as quick parameter collection & validation with the `Params` model,
as well as a few specific parameter types for quick use.

```python
from chatspec import Params
# or get specific parameter types
from chatspec.params import MessagesParam, StreamOptionsParam

# easily define a collection of parameters for a chat completion
params = Params(
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}],
    model = "gpt-4o-mini",
    temperature = 0.5,
)

# use any of the provided types from `chatspec.types`
from chatspec.types import Message, Tool, ToolCall, Completion
# ...

# create objects directly from the types easily
message = Message(role = "user", content = "Hello, how are you?")
# >>> {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
```
