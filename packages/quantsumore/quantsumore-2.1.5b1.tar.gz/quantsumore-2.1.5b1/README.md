# Introduction to Financial Analysis

The `fAnalysis` and `tAnalysis` classes, provided by the `quantsumore` library, offer comprehensive tools for conducting both fundamental and technical analysis of financial data. These modules allow users to explore a company's financial health through statements and ratios (fundamental analysis) and detect market trends, potential buy/sell signals, and volatility through technical indicators (technical analysis).

This guide will show you how to:
- Access financial statements, ratios, and common size financial statements.
- Compute technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, DMI, and Bollinger Bands.

### Setting Up Financial and Technical Analysis

#### Importing and Initializing `fAnalysis` (Fundamental Analysis)
```python
from quantsumore.analysis import fAnalysis
```

#### Importing and Initializing `tAnalysis` (Technical Analysis)

Next, initialize the `tAnalysis` class with your financial data for technical analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from quantsumore.analysis import tAnalysis

# Sample data setup
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Date': pd.date_range(start='2020-01-01', periods=100),
    'High': np.random.rand(100) * 100 + 150,
    'Low': np.random.rand(100) * 100 + 100,
    'Open': np.random.rand(100) * 100 + 125,
    'Close': np.random.rand(100) * 100 + 130,
    'Volume': np.random.randint(100, 1000, size=100),
    'Symbol': ['AAPL'] * 100
})

# Initialize the tAnalysis class
analyze = tAnalysis(data)
```

### Using Financial Statements, Ratios, and Indicators

#### Overview of Methods and Indicators

##### Fundamental Analysis with `fAnalysis`
`fAnalysis` provides a wide range of methods for accessing and analyzing financial data:
- **Financial Statements**: Income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement.
- **Liquidity Ratios**: Current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio.
- **Solvency Ratios**: Debt-to-equity ratio, debt-to-capital ratio.
- **Profitability Indicators**: Net profit margin, gross profit margin, operating profit margin.
- **Efficiency Ratios**: Inventory turnover ratio, receivables turnover ratio.
- **Common Size Statements**: Convert statements into common-size formats for easier comparison.

##### Technical Analysis with `tAnalysis`
`tAnalysis` offers methods to compute various technical indicators:
- **Directional Movement Index (DMI) & Average Directional Index (ADX)**: Trend strength indicators.
- **Aroon Indicator**: Trend detection.
- **On Balance Volume (OBV)**: Volume analysis for price movements.
- **Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line)**: Volume and price trends.
- **MACD**: Momentum and trend-following indicator.
- **RSI**: Overbought/oversold conditions.
- **Stochastic Oscillator**: Market momentum and sensitivity.
- **Moving Averages & Bollinger Bands**: Trend analysis and volatility bands.
- **ATR**: Volatility measure.

### Examples of Financial and Technical Analysis Applications

#### Fundamental Analysis Examples

##### Accessing Financial Statements

```python
# Fetch financial data for a specific ticker and period
fAnalysis('AAPL', 'Q')

# Access the balance sheet and income statement
income_statement = fAnalysis.income_statement
balance_sheet = fAnalysis.balance_sheet
```

##### Calculating Financial Ratios

```python
# Calculate key financial ratios
current_ratio = fAnalysis.current_ratio()
debt_to_equity_ratio = fAnalysis.debt_to_equity_ratio()

print(f"Current Ratio: {current_ratio}")
print(f"Debt to Equity Ratio: {debt_to_equity_ratio}")
```

##### Dividend Analysis

```python
# Access dividend data if available
dividend_yield = fAnalysis.dividend_yield()
print(f"Dividend Yield: {dividend_yield}")
```

##### Generating Common Size Financial Statements

```python
# Convert the income statement to a common size statement
common_size_income = fAnalysis.CommonSize("Income Statement")
print(common_size_income)
```

#### Technical Analysis Examples

##### Computing and Visualizing DMI and ADX

```python
# Compute DMI and ADX
dmi = analyze.DirectionalMovementIndex(period=14, adx_threshold=25)
dmi.plot_indicators()
```

##### Using the Aroon Indicator

```python
# Compute Aroon and plot
aroon = analyze.AroonIndicator(period=25)
aroon.plot_aroon()
```

##### Evaluating Market Volume with OBV

```python
# Compute On Balance Volume and detect divergences
obv = analyze.OnBalanceVolume()
obv.plot_obv_with_divergence()
```

##### Analyzing Price and Volume with the Accumulation/Distribution Line

```python
# Compute A/D Line and plot
adl = analyze.AccumulationDistributionLine()
adl.plot_ad_line_with_divergence()
```

##### MACD for Trend Following

```python
# Compute MACD and visualize
macd = analyze.MACD()
macd.plot_macd()
```

##### Identifying Overbought or Oversold Conditions with RSI

```python
# Compute RSI and plot
rsi = analyze.RelativeStrengthIndex()
rsi.plot_rsi()
```

##### Fast Stochastic Oscillator for Sensitivity to Market Movements

```python
# Compute Stochastic Oscillator
stochastic = analyze.FastStochasticOscillator()
stochastic.plot_stochastic()
```

##### Combining Moving Averages and Bollinger Bands for Trend Analysis

```python
