    Find the confidence levels (significance levels) for the given power spectrum permutations.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    ps_perm : np.ndarray
        2D array where each row represents a power spectrum, and each column represents a permutation.
    siglevel : float
        Significance level (default 0.05 for 95% confidence).
    nf : int
        Number of frequencies (length of the power spectra). If None, inferred from the shape of ps_perm.

    Returns:
    --------
    signif : np.ndarray
        Significance levels for each frequency.
