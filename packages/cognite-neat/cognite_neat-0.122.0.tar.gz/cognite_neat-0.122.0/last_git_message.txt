Neat 984 update doc and release package (#1202)

# Description

Update docs and tutorials with the latest terminology:

* *Rules* -> *Data Model*
* *Information Rules* -> *Conceptual Data Model*
* *DMS Rules* -> *Physical Data Model*
* *Class* -> *Concept*
* *Graph* -> *Instances*
* *Instances* + *Data Model* -> *Knowledge Graph*

Last bits of renaming of internal variables and methods of neat that
were missed in the previous PRs. No new functionality added!

**TO RISK REVIEWERS**: large number of lines is due to generation of
graph visualization for docs (html) file, docs, docstrings, and missed
renaming of internal vars/methods form the previous PRs.
