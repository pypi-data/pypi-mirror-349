Neat 1007 skip setting node type for instances of system space views (#1220)

# Description

CDF system (schema) space (e.g. cdm) does not contain definition of node
types. This leads to error when we try to create instances with neat, as
neat is automatically set node type for every instance , where node type
has same id (space,external_id) of view instances is being written
through.

## Bump

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## Changelog
### Fixed

- When generating instances through views from system space(s) node type
is no longer set
