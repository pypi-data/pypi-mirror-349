features:
  - |
    Static Large Objects will now be used by default for segmented uploads
    to clusters that support them. The new ``--use-dlo`` option may be used to
    create Dynamic Large Objects, as was the previous behavior without
    ``--use-slo``.

  - |
    Uploads from stdin may now be Dynamic Large Objects by using the new
    ``--use-dlo`` option.

  - |
    The ``--timeout`` option may now include 's', 'm', and 'h' suffixes similar
    to the ``tempurl`` ``<time>`` argument.

fixes:
  - |
    ``499 Client Disconnect`` responses are now retried in a manner similar to
    ``408 Request Timeout`` responses.

  - |
    Requests are retried for more SSL errors. Only certificate validation
    errors will not be retried.

  - |
    If downloaded content does not match the Content-Length from response
    headers, the reported error will now highlight Content-Length rather than
    ETag.

  - |
    Transaction IDs are now included when downloaded content does not match
    the expectations set by response headers.

  - |
    Fix an import error for some distributions by using ``importlib`` rather than
    ``pkg_resources`` when possible.

  - |
    Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.
