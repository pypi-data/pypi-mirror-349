## Introduction

`euclidlib` is an unofficial python package to read official Euclid mission products from the Science Ground Segment. The ultimate goal of `euclidlib` is to provide to the Euclid community a friendly and ready-to-use library that allows to work with the science-ready Euclid products right away. The library is maintained in a best-effort basis by Euclid volunteers and contributors. See acknolwedgements below.

## Installation

As simple as:

```sh
pip install euclidlib
```

### Prerequisites

- `python>3.7`

   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Commit your changes:
