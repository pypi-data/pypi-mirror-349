# Fortlev Solar SDK Documentation

This SDK is designed to simplify the process of interacting with the Fortlev Solar API.

**Go to:** [Docs](https://patrickpasquini.github.io/fortlev_solar_sdk/)

### Installation

You can install the SDK using pip:

from fortlev_solar_sdk import FortlevSolarClient

client = FortlevSolarClient()
client.authenticate(username="username", pwd="password")
orders = client.orders(power=5.0, voltage="220", phase=1, surface="surface_id", city="city_id")
for order in orders:
    print(order)
```
