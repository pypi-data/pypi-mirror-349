# MANIFEST.in

# Include all files within the 'pytetrad_plus' directory
# This assumes boston*.csv and *.txt are inside the pytetrad_plus package folder
# graft pytetrad_plus

# Alternatively, be more specific if files are inside the package folder:
include pytetrad_plus/*.csv
include pytetrad_plus/*.txt

# If the data files were NOT inside the 'pytetrad_plus' folder, but
# in the project root alongside pyproject.toml, you would use:
# include boston_data.csv
# include boston_prior.txt
# include sub_1019.csv

# Exclude compiled python files and caches
global-exclude *.py[co]
global-exclude __pycache__

# Exclude the build metadata directory itself if it gets picked up by graft
prune *.egg-info
prune build
prune dist
