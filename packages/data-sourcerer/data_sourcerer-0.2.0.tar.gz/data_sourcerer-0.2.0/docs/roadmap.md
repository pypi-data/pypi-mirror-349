  - ✅ Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
    - ✅ Credentials json
  - ✅ S3-compatible storages (e.g. AWS S3, MinIO, etc.)
    - ✅ Access Key/Secret Key pair
    - ✅ Profile name
  - [] Azure Blob Storage (planned)

- [ ] **Storage actions support** – Perform basic operations with ease:
  - [ ] View storage metadata
  - ✅ List buckets/objects
  - ✅ Download files
  - ✅ Upload files
  - ✅ Delete objects
  - [ ] Rename / move objects

- [ ] **Bookmarking** – Save frequently visited locations across storage accounts for quick teleportation.

- ✅ **File preview** – View contents of text files (e.g., logs, JSON, YAML) directly in the terminal UI.

- [ ] **Plugin system** – Extend Sourcerer with your own storage providers

- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts** – Improve navigation and productivity with magic keybindings.

- [ ] **Keyboard navigation** – Improve navigation using keyboard only.

- [ ] **Error and retry handling** – Automatic retries for flaky cloud responses and graceful error dialogs.

- [ ] **Cross-provider copy** – Move files between GCS and S3 in one unified action.

- [ ] **Logging** – Keep detailed logs for your Sourcerer actions and errors.

- ✅ **Encrypted config store** – Store access keys securely with local encryption.
