    URCL (Unofficial REV-Compatible Logger)
    
    This unofficial logger enables automatic capture of CAN traffic from REV
    motor controllers to NetworkTables, viewable using AdvantageScope. See the
    corresponding AdvantageScope documentation for more details:
    https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope/blob/main/docs/REV-LOGGING.md
    
    As this library is not an official REV tool, support queries should be
    directed to the URCL issues page or software@team6328.org
    rather than REV's support contact.
