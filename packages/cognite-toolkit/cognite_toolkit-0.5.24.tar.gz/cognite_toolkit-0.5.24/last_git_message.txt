[CDF-24563]Â Topological sort to fix dependencies between location filters (#1543)

# Description

Due to the Location API design, nested locations have to be created in
hierarchical order and one by one to make sure that parent exists before
child. Also, when retrieving locations on the list endpoint, they are
nested. Since our lookup depended on iterating the list, we didn't find
child locations.
