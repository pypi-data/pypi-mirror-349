Making .env override default True (#1579)

# Description

### If the user has a .env file, its content takes precendence by
default.

There have been multiple cases where the default behaviour of
load_dotenv() has confused users and caused problems because ordinary
environment variables take precedence over the .env file, for example
`CDF_PROJECT`:

What the user expects the Toolkit to use: 
```.env
CDF_PROJECT=my_dev_project 
CDF_CLUSTER=westeurope-1
...
```

What the Toolkit uses (default load_dotenv())
```
echo $CDF_PROJECT
my_prod_project  
```

The `override_env` flag is designed to avoid that, but most users are
unaware of it. We think it is unlikely that users want to mix and match.
