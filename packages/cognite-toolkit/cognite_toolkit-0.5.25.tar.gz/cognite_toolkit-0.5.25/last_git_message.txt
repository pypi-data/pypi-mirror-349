[prep CDF-24554]  Prep dump events (#1571)

# Description

Dumping assets and timeseries goes to csv/parquet format, while data
models, nodes, groups, transformations, and workflows goes to YAML thus
configuration format. Suggest we split these before the introduction of
dump events/files/location filters to make it clear what you are dumping
to disk.

### Improved

- [alpha] Introduces new `alpha` flag `dump-data` that splits the `cdf
dump` plugin command into `cdf dump data` and `cdf dump config`. This is
to make it clearer what is data and what is configurations.
