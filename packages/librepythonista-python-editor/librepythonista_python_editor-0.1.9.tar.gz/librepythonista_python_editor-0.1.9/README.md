# Python Editor for LibreOffice and LibrePythonista

This is a Python editor for LibreOffice and [LibrePythonista].
It is not intended to be a full-fledged IDE, but rather a simple editor with some basic features.

This package is not intended to be installed by itself, but rather as a dependency of [LibrePythonista](https://extensions.libreoffice.org/en/extensions/show/99231).

## Installation

Normally this package does not need to be manually installed, but if you want to install it manually, you can do so with pip:

```bash
pip install librepythonista-python-editor
```

This package is usually installed automatically by the [LibrePythonista] extension, so you don't need to worry about it.

This package is not automatically installed when using flatpak version of [LibreOffice] by the [LibrePythonista] extension. For flatpak see [LibrePythonista_PyEditor].
