# ClawPy

ClawPy is a free, open-source Python framework designed to provide easy access to powerful math, science, and machine learning tools â€” all in one modular package.  
Built with simplicity and accessibility in mind, ClawPy helps developers, students, and hobbyists explore a wide range of mathematical concepts, symbolic computation, data manipulation, visualization, and even machine learning & NLP, without the overhead of complex dependencies or paid platforms.

## Features

- Basic and advanced math operations: arithmetic, algebra, calculus, and more
- Support for vectors, matrices, and symbolic math powered by SymPy
- Visualization tools including Perlin noise and 4D animations using Matplotlib
- Lightweight machine learning and NLP training utilities (coming soon!)
- Modular design for easy use and extension
- Pure Python codebase, no heavy dependencies or compiled extensions required

## Installation

Install ClawPy directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install clawpy
```

## Quick Start

Import the modules you need and start computing instantly:

```python
from clawpy import BasicMath

# Create an instance of BasicMath
math_tools = BasicMath()

# Basic arithmetic
print(math_tools.add(8, 5))        # Output: 13
print(math_tools.multiply(7, 6))   # Output: 42
print(math_tools.square(12))       # Output: 144
```
