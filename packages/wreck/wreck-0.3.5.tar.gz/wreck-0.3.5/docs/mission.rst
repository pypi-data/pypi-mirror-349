The mission
============

1. Group requirements files by venv
2. Use tox (or nox) to run using the correct Python interpreter version
3. Fix the requirements and constraints files, without testing upon a venv
4. Support both app and package authors/maintainers
5. Adhere to the UNIX philosophy.

.. epigraph::

   Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs
   to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because
   that is a universal interface.

   `UNIX philosophy <http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html>`_

   -- Doug McIlroy, the inventor of Unix pipes

The opposite of the UNIX Philosophy is a hideous monster that bloats
into something that is too big to maintain or complicated to understand
how it works
