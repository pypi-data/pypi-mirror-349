# LDA Playground

This directory is for exploratory work, testing ideas, and experiments that aren't yet part of the formal analysis pipeline.

## Directory Structure

- `experiments/`: Exploratory analyses that might become formal sections
- `scratch/`: Temporary work and quick tests
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration

## Guidelines

- Work in this directory is not tracked in the main manifest
- Use this space to test approaches before formalizing them in sections
- Consider moving successful experiments to formal sections
