The homes for this\ndataset were synthetically generated using gpt-3.5, and then simplified for\nexercising smaller LLMs.\n\nThis is a variation on the `assist` dataset that tests far fewer entities, devices,\nand areas at once. This is designed given poor performance of local models on the\n`assist` baseline to help with even smaller tasks to focus on to improve quailty.\n\nThe use cases are not intended to be very tricky or complicated and aimed at a\nsmaller context window. The number of devices/entities in each test is intentionally\nsmall (e.g. typically under 5 entities per test) to focus on tool calling capabilities\nrather than context retrieval.\n\nThis dataset uses the `assist` format.

This dataset is in development and contains\njust a few initial examples. Each benchmark creates a synthetic home fixture\nand configures the entities with a particular state, then asks for an automation\nfor a specific set of devices.\n\nThe benchmark loads a synthetic home and runs pytest with Home Assistant to\nrun through scenarios that should trigger the automation. It also gives points\nfor getting inputs correct and each problem benchmark exercises different\nscenarios that add to the overall score. The various scenarios are not weighted.', urls=['https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/datasets/automations'], count=5, version='v0', path='datasets/automations', config_entry_data=None, config_entry_options={'llm_hass_api': '', 'max_tokens': 4096}),
