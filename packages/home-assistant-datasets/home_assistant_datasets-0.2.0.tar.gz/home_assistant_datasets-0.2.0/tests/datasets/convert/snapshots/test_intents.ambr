  description: '
  
    A dataset built form the Home Assistant intents repo, modeled after existing
  
    NLP test cases for the assistant pipeline.
  
  
    This dataset has been adapted for evaluating the Home Assistant LLM API ([blog post](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/05/20/llm-api/))
  
    imported from the home assistant intents repo.
  
  
    This is mean to reuse the tests that already exist for the NLP, which turns out
  
    to expose some weaknesses or differences of interpretation of tasks. It also is
  
    a very large home which is challenging for smaller models given the ~100 or so
  
    devices. Lastly, there are some tests that have subtle mismatches that are reasonable
    (e.g.
  
    "minimum brightness" tests)
  
  
    This dataset uses the `assist` format. See the `assist` dataset card and README
    for
  
    additional details about the format and information about running the evaluation.
