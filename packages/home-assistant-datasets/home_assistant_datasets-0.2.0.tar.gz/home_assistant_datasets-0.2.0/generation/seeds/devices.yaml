  thoughts:
    - The bungalow in a seaside village may be a vacation home or a tranquil retreat.
    - The cozy living room with a fireplace hints at a cozy atmosphere, and there may
      be smart climate control for comfort.
    - The outdoor shower is convenient for beach days, so there may be smart water heating
      systems.

    - The apartment with city views may cater to a single person or a couple.
    - The shared rooftop terrace could have restrictions on device installations.
    - In-unit laundry suggests convenience, so there may be a smart washer and dryer.

  thoughts:
    - The industrial loft with an open space and high ceilings may have a modern and
      minimalist design.
    - The panoramic windows offer plenty of natural light, ideal for a smart lighting
      system.
    - The rooftop terrace could be a great spot for outdoor entertainment, so there
      may be smart speakers or a sound system.

devices-thoughts:
  - Since the industrial loft has an open space and high ceilings, we can suggest a modern and minimalist design for the smart home devices
  - Given the panoramic windows, we can suggest a smart lighting system to take advantage of the natural light
  - There are no device-types for a smart speaker so we will omit those, but there are other appropriate devices like a motion sensor
