# thought: Since the mountain cabin is located in a rural area in Colorado and is a log cabin, we can assume a rugged and cozy feel for the smart devices
# thought: Given the cozy living room with a fireplace, we can suggest smart climate control and lighting for comfort
# thought: The separate guest cabin with 1 bedroom may benefit from smart security devices
