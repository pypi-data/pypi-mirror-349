  A dataset built to exercise the Home Assistant LLM API. The homes for this
  dataset were synthetically generated using gpt-3.5, and then manually curated
  to exercise the Home Assistant intents for controlling devices. The sentences
  were made intentionally more difficult than the existing assistant NLP for
  showcasing larger model reasoning capabilities.
