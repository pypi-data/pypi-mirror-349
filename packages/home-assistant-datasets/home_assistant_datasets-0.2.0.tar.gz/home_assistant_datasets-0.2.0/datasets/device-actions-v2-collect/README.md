# Function Calling dataset for Assist LLM for Home Assistant

This dataset is generated by using other conversation agent pipelines as teachers
from the [deivce-actions-v2](https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/datasets/device-actions-v2) dataset.

This dataset is used to support fine tuning of llama based models.

See [Device Actions](https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/blob/main/generation/device-actions.ipynb) for a notebook for construction of this dataset and the `device-actions` dataset.
