# thought: Given the country_code SE and the mention of wood-fired sauna, we can infer this is a Swedish home and assume that residents may have an interest in sustainability and energy efficiency.
# thought: Since the cottage has a vegetable patch, we can infer that the residents are interested in gardening, and potentially may have a smart irrigation system, as well as sensors for temperature and humidity in the garden.
