# thought: Since the loft apartment is in a city center, we can suggest a modern and minimalist design for the smart home devices.
# thought: Given the open-concept living space with exposed brick walls, we can suggest a smart lighting system that highlights the architectural details.
# thought: There are no device-types for a smart speaker so we will omit those, but there are other appropriate devices like a motion sensor
