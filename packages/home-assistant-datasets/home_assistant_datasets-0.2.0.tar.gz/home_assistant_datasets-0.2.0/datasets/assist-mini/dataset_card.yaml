description: |-
  A dataset built to exercise the Home Assistant LLM API. The homes for this
  dataset were synthetically generated using gpt-3.5, and then simplified for
  exercising smaller LLMs.

  This is a variation on the `assist` dataset that tests far fewer entities, devices,
  and areas at once. This is designed given poor performance of local models on the
  `assist` baseline to help with even smaller tasks to focus on to improve quailty.

  The use cases are not intended to be very tricky or complicated and aimed at a
  smaller context window. The number of devices/entities in each test is intentionally
  small (e.g. typically under 5 entities per test) to focus on tool calling capabilities
  rather than context retrieval.

  This dataset uses the `assist` format. See the `assist` dataset card and README for
  additional details about the format and information about running the evaluation.
