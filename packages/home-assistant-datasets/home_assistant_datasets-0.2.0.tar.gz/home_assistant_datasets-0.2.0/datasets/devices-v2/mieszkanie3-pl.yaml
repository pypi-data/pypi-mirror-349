# thought: Given that it is a studio apartment in a student district, we should focus on devices that offer convenience and efficiency.
# thought: The combined living and sleeping area will need multi-functional devices that cater to both relaxation and study.
# thought: The kitchenette being small may only need basic smart appliances.
# thought: Compact bathroom should have minimal smart devices, focused on hygiene and efficiency.
# thought: The shared rooftop terrace might not allow many private installations, but essential lighting if permitted.
