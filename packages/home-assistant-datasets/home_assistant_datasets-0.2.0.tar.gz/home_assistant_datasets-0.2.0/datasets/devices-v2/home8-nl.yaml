# thought: The bungalow is situated in a green area and includes amenities such as a spacious backyard and a workshop, so we can consider devices that support comfort, security, and convenience both indoors and outdoors.
# thought: Given the presence of a sunroom and backyard, we can include devices that enhance the enjoyment of natural light and the outdoors.
# thought: The carport and workshop may benefit from smart devices for lighting and security.
