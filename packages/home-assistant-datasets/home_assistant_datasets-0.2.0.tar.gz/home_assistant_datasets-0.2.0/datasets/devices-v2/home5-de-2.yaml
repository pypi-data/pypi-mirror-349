# thought: Since the house is located in a coastal town and has multiple bedrooms along with a wrap-around deck, we can incorporate devices that cater to both safety and comfort. Given it is in Germany, the devices should consider local climate and European brands.
# thought: Emphasize comfort and security due to the beach house setup, also taking into account the coastal living room and wrap-around deck, which likely have high traffic.
# thought: The smart thermostat will help in maintaining the right temperature in the living room. Motion sensors and door sensors provide security, especially for a vacation property. Philips Hue products are reliable and integrate well with European systems.
