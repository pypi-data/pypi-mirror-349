# thought: Given the terraced house in Horsens, Denmark, I will suggest a mix of smart home devices to offer comfort and convenience across various areas of the house.
# thought: The living room, with a fireplace, can benefit from smart climate control and lighting.
# thought: Bedrooms usually need smart lights for convenience.
# thought: The backyard can have outdoor smart lighting and a motion sensor for security.
