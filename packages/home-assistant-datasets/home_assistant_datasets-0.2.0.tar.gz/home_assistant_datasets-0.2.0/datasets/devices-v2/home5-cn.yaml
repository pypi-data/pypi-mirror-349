# thought: The cabin in Yunnan's mountainous area suggests a rustic and cozy environment, possibly with a focus on heating given the wood stove.
# thought: Having a mountainous view could mean leveraging outdoor lighting for added security and ambiance.
# thought: The cabins in remote areas might use smart plugs and smart lights for basic automation needs without overly relying on the internet.
