# thought: The forest cottage is a vacation retreat in a wooded area, so we'll focus on devices that enhance comfort and convenience during the stay
# thought: A wood stove suggests there might not be a traditional HVAC system, but a temperature sensor for monitoring could be useful
# thought: The screened-in porch can benefit from lighting for evening use
# thought: Given the remote location, security devices like smart locks and cameras are also a good fit
