description: |-
  A dataset for evaluating automation generation. The homes for this dataset were
  synthetically generated using gpt-3.5. This dataset is in development and contains
  just a few initial examples. Each benchmark creates a synthetic home fixture
  and configures the entities with a particular state, then asks for an automation
  for a specific set of devices.

  The benchmark loads a synthetic home and runs pytest with Home Assistant to
  run through scenarios that should trigger the automation. It also gives points
  for getting inputs correct and each problem benchmark exercises different
  scenarios that add to the overall score. The various scenarios are not weighted.
