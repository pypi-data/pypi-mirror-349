  name: Closet Light from Door Sensor
  description: >
    Automatically actitvate a light with a door sensor attached to the door,
    activating a smart switch or light.  The light will turn off at the end of
    a timer, or when you close the door.  Logic is also implemented to turn
    off the light in the event it's manually turned on while the door is open
    or after the automation has already run.
