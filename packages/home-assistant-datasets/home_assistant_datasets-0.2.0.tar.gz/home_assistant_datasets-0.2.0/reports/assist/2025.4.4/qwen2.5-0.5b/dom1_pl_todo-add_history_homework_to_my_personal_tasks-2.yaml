response: "To add history homework to your personal tasks, you can simply use the\
  \ `HassSetPosition` function. However, since we are not directly accessing external\
  \ data like a list or live context, I will need to perform a manual action using\
  \ the provided tools.\n\nHere's how you can set up and add the task:\n\n1. **Install\
  \ the necessary tools (if they're not already installed):** In this case, no additional\
  \ tools are needed since we'll be adding a task manually.\n   \n2. **Assign a name\
  \ and domain:** For your personal tasks, we will use \"History Homework\".\n\n3.\
  \ **Set the position of the task:** We will add the task to our personal tasks by\
  \ calling `HassSetPosition`.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any specific actions\
  \ or if there are other aspects you'd like to focus on.\n\nIf you provide more details\
  \ about what you want to achieve, we can proceed accordingly. Otherwise, this is\
  \ a basic example that shows how to add the task manually.\nBefore proceeding with\
  \ the actual implementation, it would be good to ensure that your device and its\
  \ context are correctly set up so I can perform the necessary actions accurately."

          Current time is 13:04:58. Today's date is 2025-05-04.
          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
