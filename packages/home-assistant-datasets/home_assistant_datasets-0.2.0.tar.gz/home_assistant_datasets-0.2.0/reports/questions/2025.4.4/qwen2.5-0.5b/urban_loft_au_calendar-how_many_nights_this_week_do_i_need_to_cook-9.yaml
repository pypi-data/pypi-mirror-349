  To find out how many nights you'll need to cook, let's first determine the current day of the week. If we start from today and go through the week until we reach a certain date, then based on that, we can estimate how many days are in the week.

  Assuming today is Monday, which is the 1st day of the week:

  - **Monday (today)**: 7 nights
  - **Tuesday**: 6 nights
  - **Wednesday**: 5 nights
  - **Thursday**: 4 nights
  - **Friday**: 3 nights
  - **Saturday**: 2 nights
  - **Sunday**: 1 night

  If we continue this pattern and go forward one day, which is the next Thursday (the 8th day of the week), then from the 1st to the 8th day of the current week, there are 7 days.

  So, if today is Monday:
  - The first weekend (Monday through Friday) will be from Tuesday to Sunday, making it a total of **2 weeks**.
  - If you need to cook more than just these two weekends, then you'll have to count up separately over the remaining week.

  Let's do this for both scenarios.

          Current time is 08:30:00. Today's date is 2025-04-02.
          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
