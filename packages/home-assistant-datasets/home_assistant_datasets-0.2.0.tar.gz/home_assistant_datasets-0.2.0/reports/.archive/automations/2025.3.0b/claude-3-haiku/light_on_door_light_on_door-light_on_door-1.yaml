    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

  \ `door_sensor` is a binary sensor that detects when the door opens and closes,\
  \ and the `light_switch` is one or more light entities to control.\n\n2. The trigger\
  \ for the automation is when the `door_sensor` changes state to `open`.\n\n3. When\
  \ the trigger fires, the automation turns on the `light_switch` entities.\n\n4.\
  \ The automation then waits for one of two conditions:\n   - The `door_sensor` changes\
  \ state to `closed`, indicating the door has been closed.\n   - A 2 minute delay\
  \ has elapsed.\n\n5. Once one of those conditions is met, the automation turns off\
  \ the `light_switch` entities.\n\n6. The `mode: restart` setting ensures the automation\
  \ restarts after the light is turned off, so it's ready to trigger again when the\
  \ door opens."

        Create a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on the user request.

        Please respond only with markdown that contains yaml. You can
        add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
        with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
        is very important to stick to the format.
