    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

        description: Binary sensor entity for the door.
        selector:

        name: Open Duration
        description: Duration before playing the alert.
        selector:
          duration: {}

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: 'open'

  condition:
    - condition: time
      after: "{{ (now() - (as_timedelta(open_duration))) | int }}"
      after_offset: 00:00:00

  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target: !input alert_media
      data:
        media_content_id: alert
        media_content_type: music
  ```

  Explanation:
  1. The blueprint starts by defining the name, description, and domain (automation).
  2. The `input` section defines the three required inputs:
     - `door_sensor`: a binary sensor entity for the door being monitored.
     - `alert_media`: a media player and media id to play the alert on.
     - `open_duration`: the duration before playing the alert.
  3. The `trigger` section listens for the door sensor to go into the 'open' state.
  4. The `condition` section checks if the door has been open for the specified `open_duration`.
  5. The `action` section plays the specified media on the target media player when the condition is met.

  This blueprint can be used to create automations that play an alert when a door has been left open for too long, allowing users to quickly address the issue.

        add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
        with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
        is very important to stick to the format.
