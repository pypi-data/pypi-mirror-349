    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  # Comments explaining the blueprint:
  # 1. We define the blueprint metadata, including inputs for the humidity sensor, threshold, and fan entity.
  # 2. We set up two triggers: one for when humidity goes above the threshold, and one for when it goes below.
  # 3. In the action, we use a choose block to handle two scenarios:
  #    a. When humidity is above the threshold and the fan is off, turn the fan on.
  #    b. When humidity is below the threshold and the fan is on, turn the fan off.
  # 4. We add conditions to check both the humidity level and the current fan state to avoid unnecessary actions.
  ```

  This blueprint fulfills all the requirements specified in the detailed description:

  1. It accepts the three required inputs: `humidity_sensor`, `humidity_level`, and `fan_entity`.
  2. It triggers when the humidity goes above or below the specified threshold.
  3. It turns the fan on when humidity is high and off when it's low.
  4. It checks the current state of the fan to avoid redundant actions.

  Users can easily customize this blueprint for various use cases, such as controlling a bathroom exhaust fan or managing humidity in a garage.
