    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here's a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on your request:

  ```yaml
  # This blueprint creates an automation to pause a vacuum when a phone call is received
  blueprint:
    name: "Vacuum Pause on Phone Call"
    description: "Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is received"
    domain: automation
    input:
      phone_call_sensor:
        name: Phone Call Sensor
        description: "Binary sensor that triggers when a phone call is received"
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
      vacuum_entity:
        name: Vacuum
        description: "The vacuum to pause when a call is received"
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: vacuum

  # Define the automation trigger
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
      to: "on"

  # Define the conditions
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
      state: "cleaning"  # Only trigger if the vacuum is currently cleaning

  # Define the action to take
  action:
    - service: vacuum.pause
      target:
        entity_id: !input vacuum_entity

  # Add some metadata to the automation
  mode: single  # This ensures the automation only runs once per trigger
  max_exceeded: silent  # Silently ignore if the automation is triggered while already running
  ```

  This blueprint creates an automation that will pause a specified vacuum when a phone call is received, as indicated by a binary sensor. Here's a breakdown of the configuration:

  1. The blueprint defines two inputs: `phone_call_sensor` (a binary sensor) and `vacuum_entity` (a vacuum).

  2. The trigger is set to activate when the `phone_call_sensor` changes state to "on".

  3. A condition is added to ensure the vacuum is currently cleaning before pausing it.

  4. The action is to pause the specified vacuum.

  5. The automation is set to "single" mode to prevent multiple triggers, and "silent" max_exceeded to ignore additional triggers if it's already running.

  This configuration allows users to easily set up an automation to pause their vacuum when receiving a phone call, addressing the problem statement and example use cases provided.
