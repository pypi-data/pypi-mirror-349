    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here's a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on your request:

  ```yaml
  # This blueprint creates an automation to pause a vacuum when a phone call is received
  blueprint:
    name: "Pause Vacuum on Phone Call"
    description: "Pauses a specified vacuum when a phone call is detected."
    domain: automation
    input:
      phone_call_sensor:
        name: Phone Call Sensor
        description: "The binary sensor that detects when a phone call is received."
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
      vacuum_entity:
        name: Vacuum
        description: "The vacuum entity to pause when a call is received."
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: vacuum

  # Define the triggers for the automation
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
      to: "on"

  # Define the conditions that must be met for the automation to run
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
      state: "cleaning"

  # Define the actions to be performed when the automation is triggered
  action:
    - service: vacuum.pause
      target:
        entity_id: !input vacuum_entity

  # Add a mode to prevent the automation from running multiple times for the same call
  mode: single
  ```

  This blueprint configuration does the following:

  1. Defines the blueprint metadata, including name, description, and domain.

  2. Specifies two inputs:
     - `phone_call_sensor`: A binary sensor that detects phone calls.
     - `vacuum_entity`: The vacuum to be paused.

  3. Sets up a trigger that fires when the `phone_call_sensor` changes state to "on".

  4. Adds a condition to check if the vacuum is currently in the "cleaning" state.

  5. Defines the action to pause the specified vacuum when the conditions are met.

  6. Sets the mode to "single" to prevent multiple triggers for the same phone call.

  This blueprint allows users to easily create automations that pause their vacuum when they receive a phone call, addressing the problem statement and example use cases provided.

        add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
        with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
