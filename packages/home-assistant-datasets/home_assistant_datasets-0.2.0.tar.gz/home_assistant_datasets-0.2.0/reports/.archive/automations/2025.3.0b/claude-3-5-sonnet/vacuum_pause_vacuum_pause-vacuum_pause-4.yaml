    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here's a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on your request:

  ```yaml
  # This blueprint creates an automation to pause a vacuum cleaner when a phone call is received.
  blueprint:
    name: "Pause Vacuum on Phone Call"
    description: "Pauses a specified vacuum cleaner when a phone call is detected."
    domain: automation
    input:
      phone_call_sensor:
        name: Phone Call Sensor
        description: "The binary sensor that detects when a phone call is received."
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
      vacuum_entity:
        name: Vacuum Entity
        description: "The vacuum entity to pause when a call is received."
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: vacuum

  # Define the triggers for the automation
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
      to: "on"

  # Define the conditions that must be met for the automation to run
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
      state: "cleaning"

  # Define the actions to be performed when the automation is triggered
  action:
    - service: vacuum.pause
      target:
        entity_id: !input vacuum_entity

  # Add a mode to prevent the automation from running multiple times for the same call
  mode: single
  ```

  This blueprint creates an automation that will pause a specified vacuum cleaner when a phone call is detected. Here's a breakdown of the configuration:

  1. The `blueprint` section defines the metadata for the blueprint, including its name, description, and the required inputs.

  2. The `trigger` section specifies that the automation should be triggered when the `phone_call_sensor` changes state to "on".

  3. The `condition` section ensures that the automation only runs if the vacuum is currently in the "cleaning" state.

  4. The `action` section defines what should happen when the automation is triggered. In this case, it calls the `vacuum.pause` service for the specified vacuum entity.

  5. The `mode: single` setting prevents the automation from running multiple times if the phone call sensor is triggered repeatedly in quick succession.

  This blueprint allows users to easily create an automation that pauses their vacuum cleaner when they receive a phone call, addressing the problem statement and use cases you provided.
