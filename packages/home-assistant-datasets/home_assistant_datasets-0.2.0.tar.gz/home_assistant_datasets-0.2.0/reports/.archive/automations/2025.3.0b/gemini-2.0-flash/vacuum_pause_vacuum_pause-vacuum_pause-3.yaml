    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

          Create a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on the user request.

          Please respond only with markdown that contains yaml. You can
          add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
          with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
          is very important to stick to the format.
