    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here's a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on your request:

        media_content_type: music
    # Optional: You can add a delay and repeat the alert if needed
    # - delay: "00:05:00"
    # - condition: state
    #   entity_id: !input door_sensor
    #   state: "on"

  ```

  This blueprint creates an automation that will trigger an alert when a door is left open for a specified duration. Here's a breakdown of the configuration:

  1. The blueprint metadata is defined, including name, description, and domain.

  2. Input variables are specified:
     - `door_sensor`: A binary sensor entity for the door
     - `alert_media`: A media selector for choosing the media player and alert sound
     - `open_duration`: A duration selector for setting the time before the alert triggers

  3. The trigger is set to activate when the door sensor state changes to "on" (open) and remains in that state for the specified duration.

  4. The action plays the selected media on the chosen media player when the trigger conditions are met.

  5. Optional: You can uncomment the additional actions to repeat the alert after a delay if the door is still open.

  6. The mode is set to "single" to prevent multiple instances of the automation from running simultaneously.

  This blueprint can be easily customized for different doors and alert sounds, making it versatile for various use cases as described in your example scenarios.
