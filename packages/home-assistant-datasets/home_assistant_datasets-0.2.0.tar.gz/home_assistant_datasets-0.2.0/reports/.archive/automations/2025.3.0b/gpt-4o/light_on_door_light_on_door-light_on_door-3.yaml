    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

    domain: automation
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: Door Sensor
        description: The binary sensor for the door (should be 'on' when open).
        selector:

  ### Explanation:
  1. **Blueprint Header:** This section includes the blueprint's name and description, helping users understand its purpose.
  2. **Domain & Input:** Defines the inputs needed by the blueprint - a `binary_sensor` for the door and a `light` entity to control.
  3. **Trigger:** The trigger is set to activate when the `door_sensor` state changes to `on`, indicating the door is open.
  4. **Action:**
     - The action starts by turning the light on using the `light.turn_on` service.
     - It then waits for one of two conditions: the door closing (sensor state to 'off') or a timeout of 2 minutes.
     - Finally, the `light.turn_off` service is called to turn off the light.
  5. **Mode:** Set to `restart`, ensuring the automation restarts if the conditions change while it's already in progress. This is important in case the door opens again during the wait period.

          Please respond only with markdown that contains yaml. You can
          add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
          with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
          is very important to stick to the format.
