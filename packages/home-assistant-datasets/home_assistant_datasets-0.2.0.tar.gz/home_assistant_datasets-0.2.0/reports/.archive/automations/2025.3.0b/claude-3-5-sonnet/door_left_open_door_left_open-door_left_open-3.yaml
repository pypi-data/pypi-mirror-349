    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here's a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on your request:

  ```yaml
  # This blueprint creates an automation to play an alert on a speaker when a door is left open for a specified duration.
  blueprint:
    name: "Door Left Open Alert"
    description: "Play an alert on a speaker when a door is left open for too long."

        default: "00:05:00"
        selector:
          duration:

  # Define the trigger for the automation
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
      for: !input open_duration

  # Define the action to be taken when the trigger conditions are met
  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: !input alert_media.entity_id
      data:
        media_content_id: !input alert_media.media_content_id
        media_content_type: !input alert_media.media_content_type

  # Add a condition to check if the door is still open when the alert is about to play
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      state: "on"

  # Add mode and max to prevent the automation from running too frequently
  mode: single
  max: 10

  ```

  This blueprint creates an automation that will play an alert on a specified speaker when a door has been left open for a set duration. Here's a breakdown of the configuration:

  1. The blueprint section defines the inputs: `door_sensor`, `alert_media`, and `open_duration`.

  2. The trigger is set to activate when the door sensor state changes to "on" (open) and remains in that state for the specified duration.

  3. The action uses the `media_player.play_media` service to play the selected media on the chosen media player.

  4. A condition is added to ensure the door is still open when the alert is about to play, preventing false alarms if the door was closed just before the duration expired.

  5. The `mode: single` and `max: 10` settings are added to prevent the automation from running too frequently and to limit the number of times it can run in a given period.

  This blueprint allows users to easily create automations for different doors and speakers in their home, addressing the example use cases you provided.
