    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Vacuum Pause on Phone Call
    description: Pause the vacuum when a phone call is received.
    domain: automation
    input:
      phone_call_sensor:
        name: Phone Call Sensor
        description: A binary_sensor entity that triggers when a phone call is received.
        selector:

            domain: binary_sensor

      vacuum_entity:
        name: Vacuum Entity
        description: A vacuum entity to pause when the automation fires.
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: vacuum

  trigger:
    # The automation triggers when the phone call sensor turns 'on'
    platform: state
    entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
    to: 'on'

  condition:
    # Ensure that the vacuum is currently running before attempting to pause it
    condition: state
    entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
    state: 'cleaning'

  action:
    # Pause the vacuum
    service: vacuum.pause
    target:
      entity_id: !input vacuum_entity

  mode: single
  ```

  - The blueprint starts with a `name` and `description` to describe the functionality.
  - `input` defines the inputs required for this blueprint: a `phone_call_sensor`, which is a `binary_sensor`, and a `vacuum_entity`, which is a `vacuum` domain entity.
  - `trigger` is invoked when the `phone_call_sensor` changes its state to `'on'`, indicating an incoming call.
  - `condition` checks that the vacuum state is `'cleaning'`, ensuring it only pauses if actively running.
  - `action` executes the `vacuum.pause` service to pause the specified vacuum when the conditions are met.
  - The `mode: single` ensures that the automation doesn't run multiple times in parallel, which is not necessary for pausing a vacuum.

          Create a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on the user request.

          Please respond only with markdown that contains yaml. You can
          add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
          with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
          is very important to stick to the format.
