    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

  ```\n\n## Step by Step Explanation:\n\n1. The blueprint defines two inputs: `door_sensor`\
  \ and `light_switch`. The `door_sensor` is a binary sensor that triggers the automation\
  \ when the door opens. The `light_switch` is one or more light entities that will\
  \ be turned on when the door opens.\n\n2. The `trigger` section listens for the\
  \ `door_sensor` to change state to `open`. This will trigger the automation.\n\n\
  3. The `action` section first turns on the `light_switch` entities. \n\n4. After\
  \ a 2 minute delay, the automation turns off the `light_switch` entities. This ensures\
  \ the light stays on for 2 minutes after the door closes.\n\nThis blueprint can\
  \ be used to automate turning on a light when a door opens, and turning it off after\
  \ a set duration."

        Create a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on the user request.

        Please respond only with markdown that contains yaml. You can
        add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
        with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
        is very important to stick to the format.
