    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  # Add a mode to prevent the automation from running multiple times
  mode: single
  ```

  This blueprint configuration addresses all the requirements specified in your request:

  1. It accepts three inputs: `humidity_sensor`, `humidity_level`, and `fan_entity`.
  2. The `humidity_sensor` input is restricted to sensors with the `humidity` device class.
  3. The `humidity_level` input uses a number selector with a slider, defaulting to 60%.
  4. The `fan_entity` input is restricted to entities in the `fan` domain.
  5. The automation triggers when the humidity goes above or below the specified threshold.
  6. It turns the fan on when humidity rises above the threshold and off when it drops below.
  7. The automation checks the current state of the fan before attempting to turn it on or off, preventing unnecessary actions.
  8. The `mode: single` setting ensures that the automation doesn't run multiple times for the same event.

  This blueprint can be easily used for various scenarios, such as controlling a bathroom exhaust fan or managing humidity in a garage, as mentioned in your example use cases.
