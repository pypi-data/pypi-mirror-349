    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: 'open'

  wait_for:
    condition:
      condition: time
      after: !input open_duration
      before: "{{ as_datetime(now()) + timedelta(days=1) }}"

  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target: !input alert_media
      data:
        media_content_id: !input alert_media.media_content_id
        media_content_type: !input alert_media.media_content_type
  ```

  Explanation:

  1. The blueprint defines the necessary inputs:
     - `door_sensor`: The binary sensor that represents the door being monitored.
     - `alert_media`: The media player and media ID to use for the alert.
     - `open_duration`: The duration the door can be open before the alert is played.

  2. The `trigger` listens for the door sensor to change to the 'open' state.

  3. The `wait_for` condition checks if the door has been open for the specified `open_duration`. The `before` condition ensures the automation doesn't wait indefinitely.

  4. The `action` plays the selected media on the target media player when the door has been open for the specified duration.
