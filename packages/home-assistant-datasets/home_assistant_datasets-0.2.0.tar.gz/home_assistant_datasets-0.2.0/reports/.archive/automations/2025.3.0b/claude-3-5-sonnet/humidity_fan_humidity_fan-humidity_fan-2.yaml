    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  # Add a mode to prevent the automation from running multiple times simultaneously
  mode: single
  ```

  This blueprint creates an automation that controls a fan based on humidity levels. Here's a breakdown of the configuration:

  1. The blueprint metadata is defined, including name, description, and input fields.

  2. Three inputs are defined as requested: `humidity_sensor`, `humidity_level`, and `fan_entity`.

  3. Two triggers are set up:
     - When the humidity rises above the specified threshold
     - When the humidity falls below the specified threshold

  4. The action uses a choose block to determine what to do based on the current conditions:
     - If humidity is above the threshold and the fan is off, turn the fan on
     - If humidity is below the threshold and the fan is on, turn the fan off

  5. The mode is set to "single" to prevent multiple instances of the automation from running simultaneously.

  This blueprint satisfies all the requirements specified in the detailed description, including:
  - Accepting the required inputs
  - Triggering based on humidity levels
  - Turning the fan on and off appropriately
  - Avoiding unnecessary actions when the fan is already in the desired state

  Users can now use this blueprint to create automations for various scenarios, such as controlling bathroom exhaust fans or managing humidity in a garage.
