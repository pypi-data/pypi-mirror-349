    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

  ```

  This blueprint creates an automation that turns on a light when a door opens and turns it off when the door closes or after a 2-minute timeout. Here's a breakdown of the blueprint:

  1. We define the blueprint metadata, including name, description, and input parameters.
  2. We set up two triggers: one for when the door opens and one for when it closes.
  3. In the action section, we use a choose block to handle different scenarios:
     - When the door opens:
       - Turn on the light
       - Start a 2-minute timer
       - Wait for either the door to close or the timer to expire
       - Turn off the light after the wait
     - When the door closes:
       - Turn off the light immediately
  4. We set the mode to "restart" to handle multiple triggers effectively.

  This blueprint allows users to easily create automations for different doors and lights in their home, such as turning on the pantry light when the pantry door opens.
