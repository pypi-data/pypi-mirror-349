    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

    # Check if the door is still open after the delay
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      state: "on"
    # If the door is still open, play the alert again
    - service: media_player.play_media

  ```

  This blueprint creates an automation that will play an alert on a specified speaker when a door is left open for a set duration. Here's a breakdown of the configuration:

  1. The blueprint inputs are defined as requested: `door_sensor`, `alert_media`, and `open_duration`.

  2. The trigger is set to activate when the door sensor state changes to "on" (open) and remains in that state for the specified duration.

  3. The action section does the following:
     - Plays the selected media on the chosen media player.
     - Adds a 1-minute delay to prevent the alert from playing repeatedly.
     - Checks if the door is still open after the delay.
     - If the door is still open, it plays the alert again.

  4. The automation mode is set to "single" to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously.

  This blueprint allows users to easily create automations for different doors and speakers, addressing the example use cases mentioned. Users can customize the door sensor, alert sound, media player, and the duration before the alert is triggered.
