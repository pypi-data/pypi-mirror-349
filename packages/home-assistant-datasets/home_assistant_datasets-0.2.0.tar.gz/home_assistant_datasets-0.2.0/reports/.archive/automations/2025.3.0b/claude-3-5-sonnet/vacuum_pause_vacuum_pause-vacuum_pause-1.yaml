    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here's a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on your request:

  ```yaml
  # This blueprint creates an automation to pause a vacuum when a phone call is received
  blueprint:
    name: "Vacuum Pause on Phone Call"
    description: "Pause the vacuum when a phone call is received"
    domain: automation
    input:
      phone_call_sensor:
        name: Phone Call Sensor
        description: "Select the binary sensor that detects phone calls"
        selector:

            domain: binary_sensor
      vacuum_entity:
        name: Vacuum
        description: "Select the vacuum to pause"
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: vacuum

  # Define the automation trigger
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
      to: "on"

  # Define the conditions
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
      state: "cleaning"  # Only pause if the vacuum is currently cleaning

  # Define the actions
  action:
    - service: vacuum.pause
      target:
        entity_id: !input vacuum_entity

  # Add a mode to prevent the automation from triggering multiple times
  mode: single

  # Add an alias for easy identification in the Home Assistant interface
  alias: "Pause Vacuum on Phone Call"
  ```

  This blueprint creates an automation that will pause a specified vacuum when a phone call is detected. Here's a breakdown of the configuration:

  1. The blueprint section defines the name, description, and input fields for the automation.

  2. The trigger section sets up the automation to trigger when the specified phone call sensor changes to the "on" state.

  3. The condition section ensures that the vacuum is currently in the "cleaning" state before proceeding with the action. This prevents unnecessary pausing if the vacuum is already paused or docked.

  4. The action section defines what happens when the automation is triggered: the specified vacuum is paused using the `vacuum.pause` service.

  5. The mode is set to "single" to prevent multiple triggers if the phone call sensor changes state rapidly.

  6. An alias is added for easy identification in the Home Assistant interface.

  This blueprint allows users to easily create automations that pause their vacuum when they receive a phone call, addressing the problem statement and example use cases you provided.
