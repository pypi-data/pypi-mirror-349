    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

          Create a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on the user request.

          Please respond only with markdown that contains yaml. You can
          add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
          with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
          is very important to stick to the format.
