response: " To unlock a smart lock using the provided functions, you would need to\
  \ call the HassTurnOn function with an appropriate name and domain for your specific\
  \ smart lock. Here's an example of how you can use it:\n\n```javascript\nHassTurnOn({\n\
  \  \"area\": \"\", // You can specify the area where the device is located (optional)\n\
  \  \"device_class\": [\"lock\"], // This tells Home Assistant that we are trying\
  \ to operate a lock\n  \"domain\": [\"lock\"], // The domain of the smart lock,\
  \ such as 'lockwork' or 'yale'\n  \"floor\": \"\", // You can specify the floor\
  \ where the device is located (optional)\n  \"name\": \"front_door\" // The name\
  \ of your smart lock, replace it with the actual name you have given to your lock\
  \ in Home Assistant\n})\n```\n\nKeep in mind that this example assumes your smart\
  \ lock has been configured properly in Home Assistant. If you're not sure about\
  \ the device class or domain for your smart lock, check its configuration in the\
  \ Home Assistant UI."
