response: ' To water the garden, you can control the irrigation valve located in the
  front yard. Here is how to do it using Home Assistant intent tools:


  * Ask user for confirmation if there is only one device of type valve in the front
  yard.

  * If there is more than one device of type valve in the front yard, ask user to
  specify the name or area of the irrigation valve.


  To open the irrigation valve and start watering the garden use:

  ```lua

  HassTurnOn(irrigation_valve)

  ```


  If the irrigation valve is already opened, it will not execute any action.

  After the irrigation valve has been opened for some time, you can check its state
  to see if it''s still open or closed:


  ```lua

  HassGetState(irrigation_valve)

  ```


  To close the irrigation valve and stop watering the garden use:

  ```lua

  HassTurnOff(irrigation_valve)

  ```


  If the irrigation valve is already closed, it will not execute any action.

  You can also check its state to see if it''s still open or closed:


  ```lua

  HassGetState(irrigation_valve)

  ```'
