response: I'm sorry, but I don't have the capability to control a specific robot vacuum.
  However, if you want to turn off or start it, I can help with that. For example,
  you could say "Start Roborock Downstairs" to initiate it, or "Stop Roborock Downstairs"
  to pause it. Would you like to proceed with one of these commands?
