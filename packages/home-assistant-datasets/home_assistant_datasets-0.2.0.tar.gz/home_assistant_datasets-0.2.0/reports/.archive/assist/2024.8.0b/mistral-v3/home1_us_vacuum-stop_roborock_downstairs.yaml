response: " It seems like the tool 'Roborock' is not currently available in your Home\
  \ Assistant configuration. You may need to add a custom integration or ensure that\
  \ you have the correct Roborock integration installed and configured correctly.\
  \ Here is a guide on how to set up Roborock with Home Assistant:\n\n1. Install Home\
  \ Assistant (if not already done): https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/\n\n\
  2. Add the following repository to your `configuration.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\n\
  source_repository:\n  - name: custom_roborock\n    url: https://github.com/custom-components/Roborock\n\
  \    ref: master\n    version: master\n```\n\n3. Restart Home Assistant.\n\n4. Add\
  \ the necessary configuration for Roborock in your `configuration.yaml` file:\n\n\
  ```yaml\nroborock:\n  robots:\n    - platform: roborock_local\n      robot_ip: <your_Roborock_IP>\n\
  ```\n\n5. Replace `<your_Roborock_IP>` with the IP address of your Roborock device.\n\
  \n6. Restart Home Assistant again to apply the changes.\n\n7. Now you should be\
  \ able to use the Roborock commands such as \"Stop Roborock Downstairs\" in your\
  \ automations or scripts."
