  input_text: Return Roborock Downstairs to base
  expect_changes:
    vacuum.roborock_downstairs:
      state: returning
      attributes: null
response: It seems like the command to start a vacuum did not match any available
  devices. The reason could be that there's no device named "Roborock" in the "Downstairs"
  area on the first floor with the correct domains and device classes for a vacuum.
  Would you like me to try another command or provide more information about how to
  set up your Roborock?
