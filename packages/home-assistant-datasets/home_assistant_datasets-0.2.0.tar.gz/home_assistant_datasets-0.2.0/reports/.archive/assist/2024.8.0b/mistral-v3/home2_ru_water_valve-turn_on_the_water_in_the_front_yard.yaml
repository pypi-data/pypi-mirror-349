response: " It seems like the tool \"Irrigation Valve\" is not defined in your Home\
  \ Assistant configuration. You'll need to create an entity for it first before you\
  \ can control it. Here's a basic example of how you can set it up:\n\n```yaml\n\
  irrigation_valve:\n  - platform: mqtt\n    state_topic: mqtt/irrigation_valve/state\n\
  \    command_topic: mqtt/irrigation_valve/set\n    value_true: on\n    value_false:\
  \ off\n```\n\nReplace the `mqtt` settings with your own MQTT broker details if you're\
  \ using a different integration. After setting up this configuration, restart Home\
  \ Assistant, and then you should be able to control the \"Irrigation Valve\" using\
  \ voice commands or other interfaces."
