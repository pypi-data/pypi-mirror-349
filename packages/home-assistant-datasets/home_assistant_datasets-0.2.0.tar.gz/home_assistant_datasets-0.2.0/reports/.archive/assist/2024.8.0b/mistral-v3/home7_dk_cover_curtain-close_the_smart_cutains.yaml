response: ' It seems that there is a mismatch between the domain and the name provided.
  Make sure you have a device named "smart_curtains" in your Home Assistant under
  the "cover" device class within the "living room" area on the 1st floor, but ensure
  it is associated with the Home Assistant domain (i.e., it should be managed by Home
  Assistant). If this device does not exist or is configured differently, you may
  need to adjust the provided information accordingly.'
