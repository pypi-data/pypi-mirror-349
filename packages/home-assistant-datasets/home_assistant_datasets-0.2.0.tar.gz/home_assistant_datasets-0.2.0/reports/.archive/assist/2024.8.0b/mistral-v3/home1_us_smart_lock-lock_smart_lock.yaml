  and given it a unique identifier. Here''s an example of how to set up a Yale YRD
  240 Z-Wave Plus Smart Lock with Home Assistant:


  1. Install the Z-Wave controller (e.g., Fibaro, Aeotec, or Zooz) and add it to your
  network.

  2. Pair your Yale YRD 240 lock with the Z-Wave controller.

  3. Add the Z-Wave controller as a device in Home Assistant.

  4. Include the lock as an entity within the Z-Wave controller''s integration.

  5. You can now use automations, scripts, or create scenes to control your smart
  lock using Home Assistant.


  For more details on setting up a specific smart lock model, consult its user manual
  or official documentation.'
