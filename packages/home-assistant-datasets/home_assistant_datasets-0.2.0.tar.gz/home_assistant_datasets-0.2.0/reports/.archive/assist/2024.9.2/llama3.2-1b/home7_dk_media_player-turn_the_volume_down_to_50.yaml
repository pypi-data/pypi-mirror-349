response: "To turn the volume down to 50%, you need to call the `HassTurnOff` intent\

  \ living_room_light\n```\n\nThis will turn off the light in the Living Room. If\
  \ there are other lights that also require turning off, this command should be used\
  \ for each one.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a loop to apply the `HassTurnOff`\
  \ intent to all entities with a specific type:\n\n```python\ndef turn_volume_down(area=None):\n\
  \    # Get all lights in the Living Room area\n    living_room_lights = HassLightSet.get_entities_in_area('light.living_room_light',\
