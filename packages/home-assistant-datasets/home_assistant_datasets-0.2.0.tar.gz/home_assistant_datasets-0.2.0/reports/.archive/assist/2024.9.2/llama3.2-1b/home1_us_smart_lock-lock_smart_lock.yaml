response: 'You can lock the Smart Lock by calling `HassTurnOn` with the area ''Entry'',
  device class ''lock'' and domain ''binary_sensor''.


  To set the position of the Smart Lock, you need to specify an area that is part
  of the ''Entry''. So, call `HassSetPosition` with the specified area.


  As for the Smart Speaker, it''s a media player, so there''s no need to lock or unlock
  it. You can play music by calling `HassMediaNext`.


  The Thermostat and Light devices don''t start timers, but they do have state variables
  that you can use to set different values. For example, you can turn off the kitchen
  light by setting its brightness to 0.


  The Backup Battery of the Smart Lock is not able to start timers, so it''s also
  safe to say that it doesn''t have a timer feature.'
