response: 'You cannot water the front yard. The state of the outlet is already closed.


  To water the front yard, you would need to turn on a different device that can perform
  this task. For example, you could turn on the Irrigation Valve Meter-reading or
  set it to a specific reading to indicate watering has started.


  If you want to start the irrigation valve automatically when the front yard receives
  no water for 24 hours, you should consider setting up a timer with HassTimer.'
