  Okay, let's see what the user asked. They wanted to add "history homework" to the Personal Tasks list. I called the HassListAddItem function with the right arguments. The response from Home Assistant says it was successful. Now I need to confirm that the item was added.

  The user might want a simple confirmation without extra details. So I'll say something like, "History homework has been added to your Personal Tasks list." That's clear and to the point. No need to mention the tool response details since the user just wants to know it's done. Keep it straightforward.
