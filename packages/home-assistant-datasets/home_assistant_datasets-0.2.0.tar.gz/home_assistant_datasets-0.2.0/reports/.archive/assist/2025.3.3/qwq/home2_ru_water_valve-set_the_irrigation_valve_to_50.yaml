response: "<think>\nOkay, the user asked to set the irrigation valve to 50%. Let me\
  \ check the available devices. The irrigation valve is in the Front yard area, and\
  \ its domain is valve. The current state is open, and the current position is 100.\
  \ To set the position to 50%, I need to use the HassSetPosition function. The parameters\
  \ should include the area \"Front yard\", the domain \"valve\", the name \"Irrigation\
  \ Valve\", and the position 50. I'll make sure to structure the JSON correctly and\
  \ only include necessary parameters. Since the user specified 50%, converting that\
  \ to an integer 50 makes sense. Let me double-check the tool's required parameters\u2014\
  position is required, so that's covered. Alright, the function call should work.\n\
  </think>\n\nThe irrigation valve in the Front yard has been set to 50% open."
