  Okay, the user asked to turn off all the fans. Let me check the devices listed. There's only one fan mentioned: the Bedroom Fan in Bedroom 1. The assistant used HassTurnOff with domain ["fan"], which should target all fans. The response shows success for the Bedroom Fan. So, I need to confirm that the fan was turned off. The user might want to know the result, so I'll say the fan has been turned off. Keep it simple and straightforward.

  The Bedroom Fan has been turned off.
