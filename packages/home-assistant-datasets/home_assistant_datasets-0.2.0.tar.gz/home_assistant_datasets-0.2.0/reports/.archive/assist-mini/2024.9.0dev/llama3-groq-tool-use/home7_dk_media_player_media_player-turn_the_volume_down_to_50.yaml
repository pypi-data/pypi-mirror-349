  expect_changes:
    media_player.outdoor_speakers:
      state: null
      attributes:
        volume_level: 0.5
response: I'm sorry, but I can't turn the volume of a media player. However, if you
  want to adjust the volume, you can tell me the specific device name and its domain.
  For example, "Outdoor Speakers" in the "media_player" domain. Would you like assistance
  with anything else?
