  Answer is in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point. To set an irrigation valve
  position, you can use Home Assistant''s `HassSetPosition` function with appropriate
  arguments such as area name (if applicable), device class or domain ("irrigation"),
  floor number if there are multiple floors within a zone of that type in your smart
  home network and the specific location where it is located.
