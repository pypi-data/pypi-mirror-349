  Okay, the user asked to turn on the bedroom 1 fan. I need to check the available devices. The Bedroom Fan is in the Bedroom 1 area, domain is fan, and it's currently off. The correct function here is HassTurnOn. The parameters should include the name "Bedroom Fan" and the domain "fan". I'll make sure to use those in the tool call. Since there's only one fan in that area, no need to ask for more specifics. The response from Home Assistant says it was successful, so I should confirm that the fan is on now.

  The Bedroom Fan in Bedroom 1 has been turned on.

          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
