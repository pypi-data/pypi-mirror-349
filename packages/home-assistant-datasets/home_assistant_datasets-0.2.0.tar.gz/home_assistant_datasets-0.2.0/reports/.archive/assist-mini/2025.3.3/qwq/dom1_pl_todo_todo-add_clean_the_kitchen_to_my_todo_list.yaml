  Okay, the user asked to add "clean the kitchen" to their todo list. I used the HassListAddItem function with the item and the list name "Personal Tasks". The response from Home Assistant says it was successful. Now I need to confirm that the item was added. Let me check the parameters again to make sure I used the right list name. The user's todo list is named "Personal Tasks", so that's correct. The response shows success, so I should inform the user that the task was added. Keep it simple and straightforward as per the instructions. No need for extra details. Just confirm the action was done.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
