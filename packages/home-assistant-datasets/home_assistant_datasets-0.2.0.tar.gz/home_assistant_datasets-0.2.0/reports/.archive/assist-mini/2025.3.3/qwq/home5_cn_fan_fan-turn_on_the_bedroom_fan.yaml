  Okay, the user asked to turn on the bedroom fan. Let me check the available devices. There's a Bedroom Fan under the fan domain in the Bedroom 1 area. The state is off, so turning it on makes sense.

  I need to use the HassTurnOn function. The parameters should include the domain as 'fan' and the name 'Bedroom Fan' to target the specific device. Since there's only one fan in that area, specifying the name ensures it's the right one. I'll structure the tool call accordingly. Once the response comes back with success, I can confirm it's done.

  The bedroom fan has been turned on.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
