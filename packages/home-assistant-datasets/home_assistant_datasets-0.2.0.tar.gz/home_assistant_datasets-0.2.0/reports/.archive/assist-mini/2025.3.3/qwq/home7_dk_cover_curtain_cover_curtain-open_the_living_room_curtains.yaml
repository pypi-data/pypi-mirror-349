  Okay, the user asked to open the living room curtains. Let me check the devices listed. There's a Smart Curtain in the Living Room under the cover domain, and it's currently closed. To open it, I should use HassTurnOn since that's for turning on or opening devices. The response from the tool call was successful, so the curtains are now open. I need to confirm that action. Just let the user know the curtains are opening. Keep it simple.

  The living room curtains are opening.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
