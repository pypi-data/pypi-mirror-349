  Okay, the user asked to skip to the next track on the outdoor speakers. I need to figure out which function to use. The available functions include HassMediaNext, which is for skipping to the next item. The Outdoor Speakers are a media_player, so the domain is correct. The name is "Outdoor Speakers", so I should pass that in the arguments. Let me check the tool response. The system responded that it was successful for the Outdoor Speakers. So the action was done, and I should just confirm that the next track started.

  I should keep the response simple. Maybe say something like "Skipped. Next track is playing on the Outdoor Speakers." That's clear and confirms the action was completed.

  Skipped. Next track is playing on the Outdoor Speakers.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
