  Okay, the user asked to close the living room curtains. Let me check the devices. There's a Smart Curtain in the Living Room under the cover domain, currently open. To close it, I need to use HassTurnOff since curtains are typically turned off to close. The function parameters should include the name "Smart Curtain" and domain "cover". I already did that in the tool call. The response from the system says it was successful. So I just need to confirm it's done. Let me say the curtains are closing.

  The living room curtains are closing.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
