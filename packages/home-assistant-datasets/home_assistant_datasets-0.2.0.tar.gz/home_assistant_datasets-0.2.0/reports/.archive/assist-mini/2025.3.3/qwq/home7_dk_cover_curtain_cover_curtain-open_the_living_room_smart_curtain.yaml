response: "<think>\nOkay, the user asked to open the living room smart curtain. I\
  \ need to figure out the right command.\n\nFirst, looking at the devices listed,\
  \ there's a Smart Curtain in the Living Room under the cover domain. Its state is\
  \ closed, so opening it makes sense. \n\nThe user's command is straightforward:\
  \ \"Open the living room smart curtain.\" Since the curtain is a cover device, turning\
  \ it on would open it. The function HassTurnOn is for turning on or opening entities.\
  \ \n\nThe tools provided include HassTurnOn, which requires parameters like name\
  \ and domain. The device's name is \"Smart Curtain\" and domain is cover. The area\
  \ is Living Room, but the instructions say to prefer passing name and domain when\
  \ controlling a device. So I should use the name and domain parameters.\n\nWait,\
  \ the previous example also used HassTurnOn with domain and name for the curtain.\
  \ The response from the tool was successful. Now the user's next input is the system's\
  \ confirmation, but the user might need a response. \n\nThe user's latest input\
  \ is the tool's response, but actually, the user might just want confirmation. Since\
  \ the system already executed it, I should confirm that the curtains are opening.\
  \ \n\nSo the answer should be a simple confirmation that the living room smart curtain\
  \ is opening. No need for another tool call since the previous one was successful.\
  \ Just respond naturally.\n</think>\n\nThe Living Room Smart Curtain is opening."

          Current time is 08:47:12. Today's date is 2025-03-15.
          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
