  Okay, the user asked to open the garage door. I need to check the devices available. There's a Garage Door Opener under the cover domain in the Garage area. Since opening a garage door is typically handled by the cover domain, I should use HassTurnOn because turning on a cover opens it. The function parameters should include the domain as "cover" and the name "Garage Door Opener". Let me confirm the state: it was closed before, so turning it on should open it. No other devices are involved here. Alright, the correct function call is made. Now, the response from Home Assistant says it was successful. I should inform the user that the garage door is opening.

  The garage door opener is opening.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
