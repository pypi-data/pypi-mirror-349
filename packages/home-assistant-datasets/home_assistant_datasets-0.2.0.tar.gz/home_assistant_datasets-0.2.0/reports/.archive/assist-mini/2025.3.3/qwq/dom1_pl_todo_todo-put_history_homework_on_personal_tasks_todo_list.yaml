  Okay, so the user asked to put "history homework" on the Personal Tasks todo list. I need to use the HassListAddItem function. Let me check the parameters required: "item" and "name" are mandatory. The item here is "history homework", and the name of the list is "Personal Tasks" as given. I'll structure the JSON with those values. Make sure there are no typos. The response from the tool was successful, so I should confirm that the task was added. Keep the response simple and straightforward, like "History homework has been added to the Personal Tasks todo list." No need for extra info since the user just wants a confirmation.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
