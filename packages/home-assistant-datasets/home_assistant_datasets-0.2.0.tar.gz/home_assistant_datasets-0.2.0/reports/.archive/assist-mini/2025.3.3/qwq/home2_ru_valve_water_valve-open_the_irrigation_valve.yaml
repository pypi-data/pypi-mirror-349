  Okay, the user asked to open the irrigation valve. I used the HassTurnOn function because turning on a valve typically opens it. The device is in the Front yard area, but since the name is unique, I specified the name and domain. The response shows it was successful. Now I need to confirm it's open.

  Looking at the device's attributes, the current_position was 0 (closed). After turning it on, the state should change to open. The user might want to know the battery and meter readings, but they only asked about opening. I'll just confirm the action was done and mention the new position if possible. Since the tools don't include a status check, I'll stick to the success message. Keep it simple: "The Irrigation Valve has been opened."

  The Irrigation Valve has been opened.
