  Okay, the user asked to close the garage door. Let me check the devices. There's a Garage Door Opener under the cover domain in the Garage area, currently open. To close it, I should use HassTurnOff since that's for closing entities like covers. The response from the tool call was successful. Now I need to confirm it's closed. The current position was 100 (fully open), turning it off should close it. So I'll let the user know the garage door is now closed.
  </think>

  The garage door (Garage Door Opener) has been closed.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
