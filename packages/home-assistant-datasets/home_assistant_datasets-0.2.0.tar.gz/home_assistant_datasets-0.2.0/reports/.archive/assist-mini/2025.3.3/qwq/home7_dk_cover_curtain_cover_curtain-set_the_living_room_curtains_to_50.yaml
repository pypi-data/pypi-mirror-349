  Okay, the user asked to set the living room curtains to 50%. Let me check the devices in the home. There's a Smart Curtain in the Living Room under the cover domain, and it's currently closed at 0%. The function HassSetPosition is needed here. The parameters should include the area "Living Room", domain "cover", and position 50. I need to make sure I use the correct domain and area. Since there's only one curtain in that area, no need to specify the name. The response from the tool call was successful, so I should confirm the action was done. Let me just verify that the parameters were correctly set. Yep, looks right. Now the curtains should be at 50%.

  The living room curtains have been set to 50% position.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
