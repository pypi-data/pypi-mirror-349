  Okay, the user asked to turn on the Backyard light. Let me check the device list. The Garden Light is in the Backyard area, right? So the correct device name is Garden Light under the light domain. I used HassTurnOn with name "Garden Light" and domain "light". The response shows it was successful. Now I need to confirm that it's on. The state was off before, but the response says success, so I should tell the user it's on. Keep it simple.

  "Backyard Light has been turned on." That's clear and to the point. No extra info needed since the user just wanted it on.

  Backyard Light has been turned on.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
