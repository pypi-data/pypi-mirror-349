  Okay, the user asked to return the vacuum in the living room to base. I need to check the available devices. The Roborock Downstairs is in the Living Room, and its domain is vacuum. The correct function here is HassVacuumReturnToBase. The parameters should include the area "Living Room" and the name "Roborock Downstairs" to target the specific vacuum. Let me make sure there are no other vacuums in that area. Since there's only one, the command should work. I'll structure the tool call accordingly.

  The Roborock Downstairs in the Living Room has been sent back to its base.
