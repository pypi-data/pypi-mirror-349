  Okay, the user asked to set the living room light to 50% brightness. I need to use the HassLightSet function. Let me check the device list. The Living Room Light is in the Living Room area, domain light. The function requires parameters like brightness and name. I'll set brightness to 50 and specify the name as "Living Room Light". That should target the correct device. Let me make sure there's no typo in the name. Yep, matches exactly. Alright, the tool call should work.

  The living room light has been adjusted to 50% brightness.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
