  Okay, the user asked to skip the song on the outdoor speakers. I need to figure out which function to use. The available functions include HassMediaNext, which is for skipping to the next item. The Outdoor Speakers are a media_player, and their name is specified. So I should call HassMediaNext with the domain as media_player and the name as "Outdoor Speakers". Let me check the tool response. The response shows success for Outdoor Speakers. So the action was done. Now I should confirm that the song was skipped. The user might expect a simple confirmation. I should just say that the song was skipped, no extra info needed.
  </think>

  The song has been skipped on the Outdoor Speakers.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
