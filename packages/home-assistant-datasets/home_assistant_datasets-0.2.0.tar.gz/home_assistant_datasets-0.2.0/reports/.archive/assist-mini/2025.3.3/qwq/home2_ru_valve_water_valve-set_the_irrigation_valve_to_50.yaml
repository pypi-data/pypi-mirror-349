  Okay, the user asked to set the irrigation valve to 50%. I need to use the HassSetPosition function. Let me check the device details. The irrigation valve is in the Front yard, domain is valve, and the current position is 100. The function requires the position parameter. I should specify the domain as ["valve"] and the name "Irrigation Valve" with position 50. The response from Home Assistant says it was successful. So the valve is now at 50%. I'll confirm that the position was updated.
  </think>

  The irrigation valve has been set to 50% position.
