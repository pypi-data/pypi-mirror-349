response: The command to close all smart curates in a given floor of your home assistant
  system is executed. The areas are specified, and the domain for these entities includes
  curtains (which refers specifically here). Thus, HassTurnOff will turn off any open
  or closed state found among them.This means that if you have multiple floors with
  different types of devices on those places then this command would work across all
  available domains in your setup!
