          The smart curtain in your house has been turned on. The state is set as
          closed at the moment, which means that it''ll be opened when you manually
          turn off and close with an action like HassTurnOff or if there are any pending
          timers for opening time! To make a different change later use actions such:
          `HassSetState` to open your curtain;  `CallServiceActionWithNoResultRegexPatternFromEntityIDsByNameIdAndTypeDomainToGetInfoForEntitiesInArea()
