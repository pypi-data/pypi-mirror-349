  I''m sorry, but I don''t have access to your Home Assistant config or media player.
  Could you please provide more information about the device and its associated entities?
  If there is a specific area for this entity (like ''Rooftop Terrace''), it would
  be helpful if we could know what kind of devices are available in that room, their
  names/domains etc., so I can give an appropriate answer.'
