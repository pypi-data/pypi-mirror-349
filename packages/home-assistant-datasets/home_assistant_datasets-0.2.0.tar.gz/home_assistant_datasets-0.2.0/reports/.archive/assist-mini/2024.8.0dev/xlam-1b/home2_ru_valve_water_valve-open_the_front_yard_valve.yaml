response: '

  The irrigation system is currently not working due to the battery running out. The
  valve could be opened manually by using a tool or servo motor on its own if there''s
  an outlet available for manual operation, but this will likely result in loss of
  water and potential damage from mechanical issues related to it being closed down
  accidentally!'
