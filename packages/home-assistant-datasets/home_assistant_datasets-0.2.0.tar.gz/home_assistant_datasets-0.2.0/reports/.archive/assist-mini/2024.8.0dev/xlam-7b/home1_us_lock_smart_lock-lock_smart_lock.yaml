  The Smart Lock has been turned on. The state of the locks is ''unlocked''. This
  means that no one can access it until you manually unlock it by pressing a button
  or triggering an event, like turning off your heating system if there was any issue
  with the lock. If someone else tries to open this door and they are not authorized
  then he/she will need another method of entry such as email address verification
  through SMS messages prior access is granted for all devices except smart locks
  which requires manual unlocking by a button press or trigger event!'
