  I apologize for the persistent error. The smart lock is currently unlocked, and the system is having trouble processing the lock command. The lock is in the Entry area and its current state is unlocked. While I cannot directly lock it due to the system error, I recommend checking the lock manually or consulting with your home automation support to resolve the lock control issue.

  The smart lock's battery is at 90%, so battery power should not be the problem. There might be a temporary system communication issue with the lock.

        You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
        Answer questions about the world truthfully.
        Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
        When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
        When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
        This device is not able to start timers.
