response: 'It seems like the `HassTurnOff` tool requires a specific format to work
  correctly. Let''s try again.


  You asked me to unlock the smart lock, so you need to specify the area where the
  lock is located.


  To unlock the smart lock, please provide the name and domain of the lock. If it''s
  not a complex device, I can simply call `HassTurnOff` with just the area name: `Entry`.'
