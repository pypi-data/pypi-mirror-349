  You have not specified an area, and I''m currently controlling the home area. If
  you want to add a new task or modify an existing one, please specify an area.


  Also, note that I''m a general knowledge assistant and do not have direct access
  to your personal schedule or calendar. The "history" I mentioned earlier is likely
  referring to a past event or appointment, but it''s not directly related to your
  current tasks or schedule.


  If you would like to add a new task, please specify the area where you want to add
  it, and then tell me what type of task you want to add (e.g., "history homework",
  "meal planning", etc.).'
