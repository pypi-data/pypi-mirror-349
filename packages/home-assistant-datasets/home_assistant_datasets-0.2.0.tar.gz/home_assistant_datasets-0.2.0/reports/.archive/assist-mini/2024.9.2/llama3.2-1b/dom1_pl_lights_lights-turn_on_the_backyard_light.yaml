  You requested to turn on the Backyard light. The HassTurnOn tool call responded
  by locking the door, indicating that the light was already turned off. To change
  this, you need to use the HassLock or HassUnlock tool call to unlock and then lock
  the Backyard door again.


  When trying to turn on a device, Home Assistant will first check if an area is specified.
  If no area is specified, it will only try to turn on devices that have a single
  area associated with them.


  To turn on all devices of a specific type in one go, you need to specify an area
  when requesting the turn on or off action.'
