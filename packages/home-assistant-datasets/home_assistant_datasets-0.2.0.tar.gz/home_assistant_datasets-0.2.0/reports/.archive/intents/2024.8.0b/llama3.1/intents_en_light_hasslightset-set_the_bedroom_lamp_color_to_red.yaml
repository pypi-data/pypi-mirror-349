response: 'It seems you''re trying to check the state of a light in the bedroom.


  I''ve checked the information available to me, and it appears that the state of
  the Bedroom Lamp is currently ''on''. The brightness level is also 102. Would you
  like to know more about this or perhaps change its state?'
