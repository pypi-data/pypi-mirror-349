  area or domain of each light device you want to control. Could you please provide
  me with the names of the devices and their respective areas? For example, if you
  have a living room lamp, it would be ''living_room_lamp'' under the ''light'' domain.
  If you have a kitchen countertop light, that would be ''kitchen_countertop'' under
  the ''light'' domain.


  Once I have this information, I can proceed to turn off all first-floor lights for
  you. example, if you have a living room lamp, it would be ''living_room_lamp'' under
