# Evaluation

This is an evaluation of Home Assistant 2024.8.0b (dev build) focused on the
`assist-mini` dataset which should be easier than `assist`. This is focused on
local models which have not performed that well on the `assist` dataset.

See [../../datasets/assist/README.md](../assist/README.md) for instructions on
how to collect and update the leaderboard.
