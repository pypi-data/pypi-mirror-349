  To control the specific devices connected to the irrigation valves in your yard using Home Assistant, we can follow these steps:

  1. First, let's get the current state of the areas and their respective devices:
     - Front Yard (area "Front yard") with `Irrigation Valve Meter-reading` device class.
     - Front Yard (area "Front yard") with `Irrigation Valve Battery` device class.

  2. Then, we can use `HassTurnOn` to turn on the device and its associated lock if necessary:

     * Open the irrigation valve (`FV1`) by calling:
       ```yaml
       sensor.valve.open_fv1:
       domain: valve
       ```

     * If you want to make sure it is in closed mode, call:
       ```yaml
       sensor.valve.close_fv1:
       domain: valve
       ```

  3. Next, let's switch off the device:

     * Turn off the irrigation valve (`FV1`) by calling:
       ```yaml
       sensor.valve.open_fv1:
       domain: valve
       ```

  In both cases, please specify which area and device class you want to control with `sensor.valve.`.

  If you need more detailed information or specific functionalities such as timers or sensors, I can provide those in a separate tool call or answer. Let me know how these steps help!

          Current time is 13:49:46. Today's date is 2025-04-27.
          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
