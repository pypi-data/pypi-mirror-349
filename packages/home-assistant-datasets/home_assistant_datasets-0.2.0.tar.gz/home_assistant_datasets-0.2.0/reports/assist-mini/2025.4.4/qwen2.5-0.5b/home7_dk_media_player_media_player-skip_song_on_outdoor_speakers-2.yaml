response: "To answer your question:\n\n1. First, I need to determine the current device\
  \ type.\n2. Outdoor speakers are connected to the media_player domain.\n3. We can\
  \ assume that they are speakers or devices with audio input.\n\nTherefore, the current\
  \ state of the outdoor speakers is \"Speaker\" (or \"Audio Input Device\").\n\n\
  To turn off a speaker:\n\n- Identify which speakers are in use\n- Unpause them\n\
  \nHowever, this doesn't match your description clearly and may not be accurate in\
  \ every scenario. \n\nA better solution would be to check if any devices in the\
  \ given areas or floors have audio input capabilities (like speakers) that we can\
  \ control.\n\nYou can provide more context or specific details about which devices\
  \ are currently active so I can assist you further accurately."

          Current time is 13:53:27. Today's date is 2025-04-27.
          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
          - names: Outdoor Speakers
            domain: media_player
            areas: Rooftop Terrace
      - role: user
        content: Skip song on outdoor speakers
