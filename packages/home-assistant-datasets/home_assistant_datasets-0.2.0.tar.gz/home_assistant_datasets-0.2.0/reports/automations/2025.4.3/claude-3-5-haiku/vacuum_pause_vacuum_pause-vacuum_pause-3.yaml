    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

    # Trigger when phone call sensor switches to 'on' state

  condition:
    # Ensure the vacuum is currently running before pausing
    - condition: state

    - service: vacuum.pause
      target:
        entity_id: !input vacuum_entity

  mode: single
  max_exceeded: silent
  ```

  Key design decisions:
  - Uses binary_sensor input for flexible phone call detection
  - Checks that vacuum is actually cleaning before pausing
  - Uses `vacuum.pause` which allows easy manual resumption
  - Runs in single mode to prevent duplicate executions
  - Silently handles max execution attempts

          Create a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on the user request.

          Please respond only with markdown that contains yaml. You can
          add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
          with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
          is very important to stick to the format.
