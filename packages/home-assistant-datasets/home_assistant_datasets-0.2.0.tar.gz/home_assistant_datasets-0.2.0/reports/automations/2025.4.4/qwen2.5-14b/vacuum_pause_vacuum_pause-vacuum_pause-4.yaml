    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  To create a blueprint for an automation in Home Assistant that pauses the vacuum when you receive a phone call, follow these steps:

  1. **Define Inputs**:
     - `phone_call_sensor`: A binary sensor entity that turns on when a phone call is received.
     - `vacuum_entity`: The vacuum entity to be paused.

  2. **Blueprint Automation**:
     Here's how the blueprint automation could look like in YAML format for Home Assistant:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    alias: "Pause Vacuum During Call"
    description: "Pauses the specified vacuum when a phone call is received."
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor
      to: 'on'
    condition:
      conditions:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: vacuum.your_vacuum_entity
          state: 'cleaning' # or another appropriate state if different from cleaning
    action:
      service: vacuum.pause
      data:
        entity_id: vacuum.your_vacuum_entity
  ```

  **Explanation of the Blueprint**:

  - **Trigger**: The automation is triggered when the `binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor` changes its state to 'on'.
  - **Condition**: Checks if the specified vacuum (`vacuum.your_vacuum_entity`) is in a cleaning or appropriate running state.
  - **Action**: When both conditions are met, the vacuum is paused.

  **How to Use**:
  Replace `'your_vacuum_entity'` and `'phone_call_sensor'` with your actual vacuum entity ID and phone call binary sensor respectively. The vacuum will be automatically paused when you receive a phone call while it’s running, allowing you to resume the cleaning manually after the call ends.

  This blueprint ensures that the vacuum operation does not interfere during important calls or meetings by temporarily pausing its activity.
