    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
response: |-
  Here's a blueprint for Home Assistant that plays an alert on the speaker if a specified door is left open for a given duration.

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Door Left Open Alert
    domain: automation
    description: 'Play an alert message when a door has been left open for a specific period of time.'
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: Door Sensor
        description: Select the binary sensor that represents your door.
        selector:
          entity:
            integration: binary_sensor
            device_class: door
      alert_media:
        name: Alert Media
        description: The media to play on the specified media player when the door is left open.
        selector:
          media:
            media_player: true
            optional: false
      open_duration:
        name: Open Duration
        description: 'The amount of time that the door must be open before triggering the alert.'
        selector:
          duration:
    mode: restart
  automation:
    alias: Door Left Open Alert
    description: 'Play an alert message when a door has been left open for a specific period of time.'
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: "{{ door_sensor }}"
      to: "on"
    action:
      - delay:
          seconds: "{{ (open_duration | int) / 60 }}"
        service: media_player.play_media
        data:
          entity_id: "{{ alert_media.entity_id }}"
          media_content_type: music
          media_content_id: "{{ alert_media.media_id }}"
  ```

  ### Instructions

  1. Copy the above YAML into a new automation in Home Assistant.
  2. Fill out the required input values when creating or editing the blueprint.
  3. Ensure that `alert_media` is configured with valid `media_player.entity_id` and `media_id`.

  This blueprint will wait for the specified duration after detecting the door open state, then trigger the alert on the selected media player entity.
