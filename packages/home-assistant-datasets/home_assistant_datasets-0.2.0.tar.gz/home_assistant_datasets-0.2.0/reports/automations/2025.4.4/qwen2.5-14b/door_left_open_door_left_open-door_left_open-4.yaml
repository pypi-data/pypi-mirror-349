    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here's a blueprint template for Home Assistant to create an automation that plays an alert on the speaker if a door is left open beyond a certain period:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Door Open Alert
    domain: automation
    description: 'Play an alert message when a specific door has been left open for longer than the specified duration.'
    inputs:
      - name: door_sensor
        selector:
          entity:
            integration: binary_sensor
      - name: alert_media
        selector:
          media: {}
      - name: open_duration
        description: 'The amount of time before playing the alert'
        selector:
          duration: {}

  automation:
    alias: Door Open Alert
    description: 'Play an alert message when a specific door has been left open for longer than the specified duration.'
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: "{{door_sensor}}"
      to: "on"
    action:
      service: template.condition
      data:
        value_template: "{{ (now() - (state_attr('" + {{door_sensor}} + "','last_changed')).to_timedelta('minutes')) | int }}"
        condition: ">"
        value: "{{ open_duration }}"
      then:
        - service: media_player.play_media
          target:
            entity_id: "{{ alert_media.entity_id }}"
          data:
            media_content_type: mpris
            media_content_id: "{{ alert_media.media_id }}"
  ```

  This blueprint listens for the door sensor's state changing to `on`, indicating that the door is open. It then waits until a certain amount of time has passed as specified by `open_duration`. Once this duration passes, it triggers playing an alert on the selected media player.

  To use this blueprint, you will need to add your actual Home Assistant entities for `door_sensor` and `alert_media`, and set the appropriate value for `open_duration`.
