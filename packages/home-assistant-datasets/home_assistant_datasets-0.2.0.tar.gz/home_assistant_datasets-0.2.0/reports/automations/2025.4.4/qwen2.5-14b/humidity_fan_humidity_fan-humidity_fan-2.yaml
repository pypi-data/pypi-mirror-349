    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  To create a Home Assistant automation blueprint that turns on a fan based on humidity levels, you can use the following YAML configuration:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: "Turn On Fan Based on Humidity"
      description: "Automatically turn on a fan when the specified humidity level is exceeded."
      trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.humidity_sensor
        to: '>=60'
      action:
        conditions:
          condition: template
          value_template: "{{ states('fan.fan_entity') == 'off' }}"
        sequence:
          - service: fan.turn_on
            target:
              entity_id: fan.fan_entity

    - alias: "Turn Off Fan Based on Humidity"
      description: "Automatically turn off a fan when the humidity level falls below the specified threshold."
      trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.humidity_sensor
        to: '<60'
      action:
        conditions:
          condition: template
          value_template: "{{ states('fan.fan_entity') == 'on' }}"
        sequence:
          - service: fan.turn_off
            target:
              entity_id: fan.fan_entity

  ```

  ### Instructions:

  1. **Replace the `sensor.humidity_sensor` with your actual humidity sensor's unique ID.**
  2. **Set the threshold in the trigger's `to:` value to match your desired `humidity_level`. Adjust from 60% as necessary.**
  3. **Update `fan.fan_entity` with your fan’s unique entity ID.**

  This blueprint ensures that:
  - The fan is turned on when humidity exceeds the set level.
  - The fan is turned off once humidity falls below this level again.
  - It respects the current state of the fan (i.e., doesn't toggle if it's already in the desired state).
