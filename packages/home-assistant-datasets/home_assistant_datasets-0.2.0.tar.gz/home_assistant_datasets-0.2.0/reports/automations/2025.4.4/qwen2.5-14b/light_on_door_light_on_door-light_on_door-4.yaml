    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Here's a blueprint automation for Home Assistant that turns on a light when a door opens and turns it off when the door closes or after a 2-minute timeout:

  ```yaml
  alias: Turn On Light When Door Opens
  description: 'Turns on a light when a door opens, and turns it off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.'
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
      to: "on"
  condition: []
  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: light.switch
  mode: single
  max_exceeded: false
  variables: {}
  ```

  For the timeout part, you need to include a delay action:

  ```yaml
  alias: Turn On Light When Door Opens
  description: 'Turns on a light when a door opens, and turns it off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.'
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
      to: "on"
  condition: []
  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: light.switch

    # Delay for 2 minutes before turning off the light
    - delay:
        seconds: 120
      then:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
          state: "off"
        - service: light.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: light.switch

  mode: single
  max_exceeded: false
  variables: {}
  ```

  This blueprint ensures that the light will turn off after 2 minutes if the door is still open, or immediately when the door closes. Replace `binary_sensor.door_sensor` and `light.switch` with your actual entity IDs.
