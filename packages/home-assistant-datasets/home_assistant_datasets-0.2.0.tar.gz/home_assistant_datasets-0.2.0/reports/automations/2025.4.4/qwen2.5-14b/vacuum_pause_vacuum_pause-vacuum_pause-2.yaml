    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  To create a Home Assistant blueprint that pauses the vacuum when you receive a phone call, follow these steps:

  1. Go to the "Automation" section in Home Assistant's UI.
  2. Click on "+ Add Automation".
  3. Choose "From scratch" or use the "Blueprints" option and select this custom blueprint.

  Here is an example of how the automation can be structured as YAML for manual input:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: 'Pause Vacuum When Phone Call Received'
      trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor
        to: 'on'
      condition:
        conditions:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: vacuum.vacuum_entity
            state: 'cleaning'  # Ensure the vacuum is running.
      action:
        service: vacuum.pause
        target:
          entity_id: vacuum.vacuum_entity
  ```

  Replace `binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor` and `vacuum.vacuum_entity` with your actual Home Assistant entity IDs.

  This automation will pause the specified vacuum when the binary sensor indicating a phone call changes to 'on', provided that the vacuum is currently in a cleaning state. The vacuum can then be resumed manually once you're done with the call.
