    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.
response: "To create a Home Assistant blueprint that pauses a vacuum when you receive\

  \n3. **Explanation of the Blueprint:**\n\n- The `trigger` section waits for a state\
  \ change event on the specified `phone_call_sensor`. When this sensor changes to\
  \ 'on', it triggers the automation.\n  \n- The `condition` checks if the vacuum\
  \ is in either 'cleaning' or 'docking' states before pausing. This ensures that\
  \ the vacuum is actually running and not idle.\n\n- The `action` section pauses\
  \ the specified vacuum when conditions are met, using the `vacuum.pause` service.\n\
  \n4. **Inputs:**\n\n- Ensure you replace the example values with your actual entity\
  \ IDs when creating the automation in Home Assistant.\n  \nTo use this blueprint:\n\
  \n1. Copy and paste the provided YAML into a new automation configuration file or\
  \ within the Home Assistant frontend under \"Blueprints\".\n2. Replace `!input phone_call_sensor`\
  \ and `!input vacuum_entity` placeholders with your actual sensor and vacuum entity\
  \ IDs.\n\nThis setup will effectively pause your vacuum when you receive a phone\
  \ call, preventing interruptions during calls or meetings."
