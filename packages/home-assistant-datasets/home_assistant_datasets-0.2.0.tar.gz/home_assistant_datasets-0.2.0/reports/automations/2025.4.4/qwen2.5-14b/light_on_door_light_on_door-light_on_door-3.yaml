    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

  Here is an example of how you could create a blueprint for turning on a light when a door opens in Home Assistant:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Turn on light when door opens
    domain: automation
    inputs:
      - variable: door_sensor
        name: Door Sensor
        description: "A binary sensor that triggers the automation to start."
        icon: mdi:door-open
        required: true
        selector:
          entity:
            integration: binary_sensor
            device_class: opening

      - variable: light_switch
        name: Light Switch
        description: "The light(s) to turn on when the door opens and turn off after a timeout."
        icon: mdi:lightbulb-on
        required: true
        selector:
          entity:
            integration: light
            multiple: true

  automation:
    alias: Turn on light when door opens
    description: "Turns on specified lights when a door is opened, and turns them off after closing or timeout."
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: "{{ door_sensor }}"
      to: 'on'
    action:
      - service: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: "{{ light_switch }}"
      - delay:
          hours: 0
          minutes: 2
          seconds: 0
      - service: light.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: "{{ light_switch }}"
  ```

  This blueprint automation does the following:

  1. **Trigger**: When the `door_sensor` changes state to 'on' (indicating that the door is open).
  2. **Action**: It turns on the specified `light_switch`.
  3. **Timeout Delay**: After 2 minutes, it will turn off the light.

  This ensures that the light turns on when someone opens the door and stays on for a set period before automatically turning off to save energy or avoid leaving lights unnecessarily lit.
