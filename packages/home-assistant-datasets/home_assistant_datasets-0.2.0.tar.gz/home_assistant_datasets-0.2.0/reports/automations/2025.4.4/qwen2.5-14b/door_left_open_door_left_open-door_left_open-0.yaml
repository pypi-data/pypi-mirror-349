    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here's a blueprint for Home Assistant that plays an alert on a speaker if a door is left open beyond a specified period:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Alert When Door Left Open
    description: Play an alert through a media player when a binary sensor has been in the 'on' state (open) longer than a specified duration.
    domain: automation
    inputs:
      - name: door_sensor
        selector:
          entity:
            classes:
              - binary_sensor
      - name: alert_media
        selector:
          media: {}
      - name: open_duration
        description: Duration before triggering the alert (e.g., "00:15", "30m").
        selector:
          duration: {}

  automation:
    alias: Alert When Door Left Open
    description: Play an alert through a media player when a binary sensor has been in the 'on' state longer than a specified duration.
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: "{{ door_sensor }}"
      to: "on"
    action:
      - service: homeassistant.wait
        data:
          delay: "{{ open_duration }}"
      - condition:
          conditions:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: "{{ door_sensor }}"
              state: "on"
        then:
          - service: media_player.play_media
            data:
              entity_id: "{{ alert_media.entity_id }}"
              media_content_type: music
              media_content_id: "{{ alert_media.media_id }}"
  ```

  ### Usage Example

  To use this blueprint, you would go to the Home Assistant frontend and create a new automation. Select "From blueprint" and choose your newly created blueprint "Alert When Door Left Open". Fill in the inputs as follows:

  - `door_sensor`: The binary sensor entity ID (e.g., `binary_sensor.front_door`)
  - `alert_media`: A media player along with the alert's media URL or ID
  - `open_duration`: Duration to wait before triggering the alert, for example "00:30" for 30 minutes

  This automation will play an alert on the specified speaker if the door has been left open longer than the given duration.
