    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here's a blueprint template you can use in Home Assistant to create an automation that plays an alert on a speaker when a door is left open:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Alert When Door Left Open
    domain: automation
    inputs:
      - name: door_sensor
        selector:
          entity:
            class: binary_sensor
      - name: alert_media
        selector:
          media_player:
            select_source: true
            select_volume_level: true
      - name: open_duration
        description: Duration before playing the alert.
        selector:
          duration: {}

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: "{{ door_sensor }}"
      to: "on"

  action:
    - delay:
        hours: "{{ (open_duration | int(60)) / 3600 }} "
        minutes: "{{ (open_duration | int(60) % 3600) // 60 }}"
        seconds: "{{ open_duration | int(60) % 60 }}"
      service: media_player.play_media
      data:
        entity_id: "{{ alert_media.entity_id }}"
        media_content_type: music
        media_content_id: "{{ alert_media.media_id }}"
  ```

  To use this blueprint, you would configure the `door_sensor` input to be a binary sensor that monitors your door, set the `alert_media` input with the appropriate media player and sound file or URL, and specify the `open_duration` as required.

  For example:
  - Set `door_sensor` to `binary_sensor.garage_door`.
  - Choose `alert_media` from a list of available speakers/media players.
  - Specify `open_duration` as 1800 (30 minutes).

  This automation will trigger when your specified door is open, and if the duration exceeds the set period, it will play the alert on the selected speaker.
