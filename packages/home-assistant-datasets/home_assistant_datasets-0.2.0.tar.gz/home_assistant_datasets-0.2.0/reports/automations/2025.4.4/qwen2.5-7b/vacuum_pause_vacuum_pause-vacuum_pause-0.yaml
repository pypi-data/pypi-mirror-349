    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here's a simple Home Assistant automation blueprint that meets your requirements:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
      triggered_by:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor
          to: 'on'
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: vacuum_entity
          state: 'cleaning'
      action:
        service: vacuum.pause
        target:
          entity_id: vacuum_entity
  ```

  ### Explanation:

  - **Trigger**: The automation triggers when the `binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor` changes to `'on'`.
  - **Condition**: It checks if the vacuum (`vacuum_entity`) is currently in a 'cleaning' state.
  - **Action**: If both conditions are met, it pauses the vacuum using the `vacuum.pause` service.

  Make sure to replace `binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor` and `vacuum_entity` with your actual sensor and entity IDs.
