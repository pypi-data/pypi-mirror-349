    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Here is a simple Home Assistant automation that turns on a light when a door opens and turns it off after 2 minutes if the door stays open:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: Turn on light when door opens
      trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
          to: 'open'
      action:
        - service: light.turn_on
          data:
            entity_id: light.pantry_light

    - alias: Turn off light after 2 minutes
      trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
          to: 'closed'
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
          state: open
      action:
        - service: light.turn_off
          data:
            entity_id: light.pantry_light

    - alias: Turn off light after timeout
      trigger:
        - platform: delay
          seconds: 120
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
          state: open
      action:
        - service: light.turn_off
          data:
            entity_id: light.pantry_light
  ```

  ### Explanation:

  - The first automation turns on the light when the door opens.
  - The second automation checks if the door remains open for 2 minutes. If it does, it will turn off the light after this delay.
  - The third automation ensures that if the door is still open by the end of the delay (2 minutes), the light will be turned off.

  Make sure to replace `binary_sensor.door_sensor` and `light.pantry_light` with your actual sensor and light entity IDs.
