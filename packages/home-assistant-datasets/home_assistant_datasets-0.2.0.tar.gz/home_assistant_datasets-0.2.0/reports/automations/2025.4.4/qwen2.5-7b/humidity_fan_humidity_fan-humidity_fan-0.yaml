    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  Here's a blueprint automation for Home Assistant based on your requirements:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: Turn on Fan Based on Humidity
      trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.humidity_sensor
        attribute: state
        operator: >
          lambda old_state, new_state: float(new_state.state) > config['humidity_level']
      condition:
        condition: state
        entity_id: fan.fan_entity
        state: 'off'
      action:
        service: fan.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: fan.fan_entity

    - alias: Turn off Fan Based on Humidity
      trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.humidity_sensor
        attribute: state
        operator: >
          lambda old_state, new_state: float(new_state.state) < config['humidity_level']
      condition:
        condition: state
        entity_id: fan.fan_entity
        state: 'on'
      action:
        service: fan.turn_off
  ```

  ### Explanation:

  1. **Triggers**:
     - `Turn on Fan Based on Humidity`: Triggers when the humidity level goes above the configured threshold.
     - `Turn off Fan Based on Humidity`: Triggers when the humidity level goes below the configured threshold.

  2. **Conditions**:
     - Ensures the fan is currently off before turning it on, and ensures the fan is currently on before turning it off.

  3. **Actions**:
     - Turns on the fan if it's not already on.
     - Turns off the fan if it's not needed anymore.

  ### Inputs:

  - `humidity_sensor`: The entity ID of your humidity sensor (e.g., `sensor.bathroom_humidity`).
  - `humidity_level`: A number selector to set the humidity threshold level.
  - `fan_entity`: The entity ID of your fan (e.g., `fan.exhaust_fan`).

  ### Example:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: Turn on Fan Based on Humidity
      trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.bathroom_humidity
        attribute: state
        operator: >
          lambda old_state, new_state: float(new_state.state) > 60.0
      condition:
        condition: state
        entity_id: fan.exhaust_fan
        state: 'off'
      action:
        service: fan.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: fan.exhaust_fan

    - alias: Turn off Fan Based on Humidity
      trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.bathroom_humidity
        attribute: state
        operator: >
          lambda old_state, new_state: float(new_state.state) < 60.0
      condition:
        condition: state
        entity_id: fan.exhaust_fan
        state: 'on'
      action:
        service: fan.turn_off
  ```

  This automation will turn on the fan when the humidity exceeds a specified level and turn it off when the humidity drops below that level, ensuring the fan operates only as needed.
