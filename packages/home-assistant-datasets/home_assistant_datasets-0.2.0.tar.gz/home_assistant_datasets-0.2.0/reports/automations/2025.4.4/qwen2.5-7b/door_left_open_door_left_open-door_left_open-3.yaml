    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
response: |-
  To create this automation in Home Assistant, follow these steps:

  1. **Set up the Automation:**
     - Go to the Developer Tools > Automations > Create.

  2. **Configure the Trigger:**
     - Select "When a binary sensor changes state"
     - Entity: `door_sensor`
     - From: `off` (or `closed`)
     - To: `on` (or `open`)

  3. **Add Condition (Optional):**
     - If you want to check if the door has been open for more than a certain duration, add a "Condition" step.
     - Use a script or condition that checks the state of the sensor over time.

  4. **Configure the Action:**
     - Add an action: "Play media"
     - Entity: `alert_media`
     - Media ID: Enter your media file ID (e.g., URL, local file path)

  5. **Set the Open Duration (Optional):**
     - If using a condition to check duration, set this up there or use a timer script.

  Example YAML for Automation:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: "Play alert when door left open"
      trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door
        from: 'off'
        to: 'on'
      condition:
        condition: template
        value_template: "{{ states('binary_sensor.front_door') == 'on' and (now() - state_attr('binary_sensor.front_door', 'last_changed')) > duration('00:30:00') }}"
      action:
        service: media_player.play_media
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.kitchen_speaker
          media_content_id: 'path/to/your/alert_sound.mp3'
  ```

  Replace `binary_sensor.front_door` with your specific door sensor and adjust the duration as needed.
