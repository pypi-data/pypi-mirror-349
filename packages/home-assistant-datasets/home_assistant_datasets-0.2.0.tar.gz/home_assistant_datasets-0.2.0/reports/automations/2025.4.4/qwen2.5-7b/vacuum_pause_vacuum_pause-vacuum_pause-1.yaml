    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.
response: |-
  To create this automation in Home Assistant, you can use the following blueprint:

  ```yaml
  - id: pause_vacuum_on_phone_call
    alias: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor
        to: 'on'
    condition:
      condition: state
      entity_id: vacuum_entity
      state: 'cleaning'
    action:
      service: vacuum.pause
      target:
        entity_id: vacuum_entity
  ```

  ### Explanation:

  - **Trigger**: The automation will trigger when the `binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor` changes to `'on'`.
  - **Condition**: Check if the `vacuum_entity` is currently in the state of `'cleaning'`.
  - **Action**: When both conditions are met, it will pause the vacuum using the `vacuum.pause` service.

  Make sure to replace `binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor` and `vacuum_entity` with your actual entity IDs.
