    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here’s a simple Home Assistant blueprint automation to achieve your requirements:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: Play Alert When Door Left Open
      trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door_sensor
          to: 'on'
      condition:
        - condition: numeric_state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door_sensor
          below_or_equal: 0
      action:
        - service: media_player.play_media
          data:
            entity_id: media_player.kitchen_speaker
            media_content_id: '<your-media-id>'
            media_content_type: 'music'
  ```

  To make this more dynamic based on the inputs you provided, use the following configuration:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: Play Alert When Door Left Open
      trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: {{ door_sensor }}
          to: 'on'
      condition:
        - condition: numeric_state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door_sensor
          below_or_equal: 0
      action:
        - service: media_player.play_media
          data_template:
            entity_id: {{ alert_media.entity_id }}
            media_content_id: {{ alert_media.media_id }}
            media_content_type: 'music'
  ```

  Replace `<your-media-id>` with the actual media ID you want to play. You can set `door_sensor` and `alert_media` as input variables in your automation configuration.

  For example, when creating this automation via UI:
  - Set `door_sensor` to `binary_sensor.front_door_sensor`
  - Set `alert_media.entity_id` to `media_player.kitchen_speaker`
  - Set `alert_media.media_id` to the desired media ID
  - Set `open_duration` as needed (e.g., 5 minutes)

  This will trigger an alert on your selected speaker if the door is left open for the specified duration.
