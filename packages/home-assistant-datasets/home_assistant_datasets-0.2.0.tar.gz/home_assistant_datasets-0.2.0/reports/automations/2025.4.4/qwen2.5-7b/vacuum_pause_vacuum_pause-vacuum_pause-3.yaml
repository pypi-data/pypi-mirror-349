    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here's a simple Home Assistant Blueprint automation to pause your vacuum cleaner when you receive a phone call:

  1. **Create a New Automation:**
     - Go to `Configuration` > `Automations`.
     - Click the `+` icon to create a new automation.

  2. **Set Up Conditions and Trigger:**

  ```yaml
  - id: pause_vacuum_on_phone_call
    alias: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor
      to: 'on'
    condition:
      condition: state
      entity_id: vacuum_entity
      state: 'cleaning'
    action:
      service: vacuum.pause
      target:
        entity_id: vacuum_entity
  ```

  3. **Save and Name the Automation:**
     - Give it a descriptive name like "Pause Vacuum on Phone Call".
     - Click `Create` to save your automation.

  This automation will pause the specified vacuum cleaner when you receive a phone call (if the vacuum is currently running). The vacuum can be resumed manually after the call ends.
