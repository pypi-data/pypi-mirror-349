    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

  Here's a simple Home Assistant Blueprint automation that meets your requirements:

  1. **Name**: Light On Door Open

  2. **Trigger**:
     - `binary_sensor.door_sensor`: Turned ON (door opens)

  3. **Action**:
     - `light.turn_on`:
       - Targets: `light_switch`

  4. **Condition** (optional, but recommended for timeout):
     - `state`:
       - Entity: `binary_sensor.door_sensor`
       - Attribute: `state`
       - Condition: `is not state 'ON'` (door closes or is manually turned off)

  5. **Timeout**:
     - After 2 minutes of the door being open, run an action to turn off the light.

  ### Example YAML

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: "Turn on Light When Door Opens"
      trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
          to: 'ON'
      action:
        service: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light_switch
  ```

  ### Timeout Service

  For the timeout, you can add another automation that triggers after 2 minutes of the door being open:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: "Turn off Light After Door is Closed"
      trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
          to: 'OFF'
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
          attribute: state
          value: 'ON'
      action:
        service: light.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: light_switch
  ```

  This setup ensures the light turns on when the door opens and off after 2 minutes if it remains open or when the door closes.
