    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
response: |-
  To create this automation in Home Assistant, you can use the following steps:

  1. **Setup the Input Variables:**
     - `door_sensor`: Select a binary sensor entity that monitors your door (e.g., `binary_sensor.front_door`).
     - `alert_media`: Choose a media player and the alert sound or message.
     - `open_duration`: Set the duration for which the door should be open before triggering the alert.

  2. **Create the Automation:**
     ```yaml
     automations:
       - alias: "Alert if Door Left Open"
         trigger:
           platform: state
           entity_id: "{{ trigger.platform_state.entity }}"
           to: "on"  # or "true", depending on how your sensor indicates open state
         condition:
           condition: duration
           description: "Door has been left open for {{ trigger.open_duration }} minutes"
           seconds: "{{ trigger.open_duration.seconds }}"
         action:
           service: media_player.play_media
           data_template:
             entity_id: {% if trigger.alert_media == 'living_room' %}media_player.living_room_speaker{% else %}media_player.kitchen_bluetooth{% endif %}
             media_content_type: "music"
             media_content_id: "{{ trigger.alert_media }}"
     ```

  3. **Configure Inputs in UI or YAML:**
     - In the Home Assistant configuration UI, you can set up these inputs as custom variables and use them to parameterize your automation.
     - Alternatively, you can directly set the values in the `configuration.yaml` file:
       ```yaml
       input_selector:
         door_sensor:
           name: "Door Sensor"
           selector_type: entity
           entities: [binary_sensor.front_door]
         alert_media:
           name: "Alert Media"
           selector_type: media
           options: [living_room, kitchen_bluetooth]
         open_duration:
           name: "Open Duration (minutes)"
           selector_type: duration

       automations:
       - alias: "Alert if Door Left Open"
         trigger:
           platform: state
           entity_id: "{{ trigger.platform_state.entity }}"
           to: "on"  # or "true", depending on how your sensor indicates open state
         condition:
           condition: duration
           description: "Door has been left open for {{ trigger.open_duration }} minutes"
           seconds: "{{ trigger.open_duration.seconds }}"
         action:
           service: media_player.play_media
           data_template:
             entity_id: {% if input_selector.alert_media == 'living_room' %}media_player.living_room_speaker{% else %}media_player.kitchen_bluetooth{% endif %}
             media_content_type: "music"
             media_content_id: "{{ input_selector.alert_media }}"
       ```

  4. **Test the Automation:**
     - Test by opening and closing your door sensor and verifying that the alert is played after the specified duration.

  This setup ensures you can customize which door, when to play the alert, and on which speaker, making it flexible for various scenarios.
