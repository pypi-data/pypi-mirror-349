    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here's a simple Home Assistant automation that meets your requirements:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
      triggered_by:
        - entity: binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor
          platform: state
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: vacuum_entity
          state: 'cleaning'
      action:
        - service: vacuum.pause
          target:
            entity_id: vacuum_entity
  ```

  Replace `phone_call_sensor` with the actual name of your phone call binary sensor and `vacuum_entity` with the actual ID of your vacuum.

  This automation will pause the specified vacuum when a phone call is detected, assuming it's currently in cleaning mode.
