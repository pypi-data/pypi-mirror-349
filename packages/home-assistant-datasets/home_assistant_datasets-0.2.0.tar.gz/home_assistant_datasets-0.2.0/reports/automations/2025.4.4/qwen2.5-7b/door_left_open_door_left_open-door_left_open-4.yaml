    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here's a Home Assistant automation blueprint to achieve your requirements:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: "Play alert if door left open"
      trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
        to: 'on'
      condition:
        condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
        state: 'on'
      action:
        service: media_player.play_media
        data_template:
          entity_id: media_player.alert_media_player
          media_content_id: "{{ states('input_select.alert_media') }}"
          media_content_type: 'alert'
  ```

  You need to adjust `binary_sensor.door_sensor` with your actual door sensor name and configure the `input_select.alert_media` to include your desired media options.

  To add a duration condition, you can use state changes or timers. Here is an example using a timer:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: "Play alert if door left open for {{ states('input_number.open_duration') }}"
      trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
        to: 'on'
      condition:
        condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
        state: 'on'
      action:
        - service: timer.create
          data:
            duration: "{{ states('input_number.open_duration') }}"
            entity_id: timer.door_open_timer

    - alias: "Play alert if door stays open"
      trigger:
        platform: timer
        entity_id: timer.door_open_timer
        event: expired
      action:
        service: media_player.play_media
        data_template:
          entity_id: media_player.alert_media_player
          media_content_id: "{{ states('input_select.alert_media') }}"
          media_content_type: 'alert'
  ```

  In this setup, the `input_number.open_duration` should be set to the desired duration (e.g., 30 minutes). Adjust the service and entities as needed for your configuration.
