    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.
response: |-
  To create this automation, you will use Home Assistant Blueprints with a simple condition and action. Here's how:

  1. **Create a new Blueprint:**
     - Go to the Integrations tab in Home Assistant web interface.
     - Click on "Blueprints" and then "New Blueprint".
     - Name your blueprint something like `Pause Vacuum on Phone Call`.

  2. **Inputs Configuration:**
     - Add two inputs:
       - `phone_call_sensor`: Select or create a binary sensor that detects when you receive a phone call.
       - `vacuum_entity`: Choose the vacuum entity (e.g., `vacuum.my_vacuum`).

  3. **Triggers and Conditions:**
     - Triggers: No triggers are needed here as we will use the input directly.
     - Condition: Check if the `phone_call_sensor` is turned on (`on` state) and the `vacuum_entity` is not paused.

  4. **Action:**
     - Use the `vacuum.pause` service to pause the vacuum entity when a phone call is detected, but ensure it's currently running.

  Here’s an example of what your Blueprint JSON might look like:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    title: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
    inputs:
      phone_call_sensor:
        name: Phone Call Sensor
        type: string
        description: Binary sensor entity to detect phone calls.
      vacuum_entity:
        name: Vacuum Entity
        type: string
        description: Vacuum entity to pause.

  conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: {{ trigger.inputs.phone_call_sensor }}
    state: 'on'
    variables:
      - variable_name: is_vacuum_running
        value: >-
          ({{ trigger.inputs.vacuum_entity.state | as_string }} != 'off')

  actions:
  - service: vacuum.pause
    data_template:
      entity_id: {{ trigger.inputs.vacuum_entity }}
  ```

  5. **Save and Trigger:**
     - Save the blueprint.
     - Test by making a phone call or changing the state of your `phone_call_sensor`.

  This setup ensures that when you receive a phone call (as detected by the sensor), the vacuum will pause if it is currently running, allowing you to use your device without interruptions.
