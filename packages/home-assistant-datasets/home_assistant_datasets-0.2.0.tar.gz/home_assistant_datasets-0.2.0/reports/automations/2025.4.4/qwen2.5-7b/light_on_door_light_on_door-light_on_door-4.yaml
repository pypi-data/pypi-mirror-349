    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Here’s how you can set up an automation in Home Assistant to achieve this:

  1. Go to the Automation section of Home Assistant.

  2. Click on "Create New Automation".

  3. Set the trigger:
     - Trigger Type: `binary_sensor`
     - Sensor: Select your `door_sensor`

  4. Add a condition (optional, but good for robustness):
     - Condition Type: `state`
     - State: `on` (to ensure it only acts when the door is open)

  5. Add an action:
     - Action: `turn on`
     - Entity: Select your `light_switch`

  6. Add a condition to turn off the light after 2 minutes:
     - Condition Type: `state`
     - Sensor: `binary_sensor.door_sensor` (or similar)
     - State: `off`
     - For: `2 min`

  7. Save and name the automation.

  This will turn on the light when the door opens, and automatically turn it off after 2 minutes if the door is closed again during that time.
