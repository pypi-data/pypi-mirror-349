    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Here's a simple Home Assistant blueprint for your use case:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: Turn on light when door opens
      trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.door_sensor
          to: 'opened'
      action:
        - service: light.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: light.pantry_light
      condition: []
      mode: single
      timeout_mins: 2
  ```

  ### Explanation:

  - **Trigger**: This automation triggers when the `binary_sensor.door_sensor` state changes to 'opened'.
  - **Action**: It turns on the specified `light.pantry_light`.
  - **Timeout Mins**: The light will turn off automatically after 2 minutes if no further trigger events are received.
  - **Mode**: Set to `single` so it only runs once per door opening and closing cycle.

  You can adjust the entity IDs (`binary_sensor.door_sensor` and `light.pantry_light`) as needed for your setup.
