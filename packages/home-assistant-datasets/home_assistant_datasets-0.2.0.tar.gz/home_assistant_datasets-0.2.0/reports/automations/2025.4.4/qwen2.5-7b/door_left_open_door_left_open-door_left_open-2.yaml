    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here's a Home Assistant blueprint automation to achieve this:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: Play alert if door left open
      trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.garage_door_sensor
        to: 'on'
      condition:
        condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.garage_door_sensor
        state: 'on'
      action:
        - delay:
            seconds: {{ trigger.duration.seconds }}
          then:
            - service: media_player.play_media
              data:
                entity_id: media_player.living_room_speaker
                media_content_type: 'audio/mpeg'
                media_content_id: 'file:///path/to/alert_sound.mp3'
  ```

  ### Explanation:

  1. **Trigger**: The automation triggers when the `binary_sensor.garage_door_sensor` state changes to 'on', indicating the door is open.
  2. **Condition**: It checks if the sensor is indeed open (state is 'on').
  3. **Action**:
     - **Delay**: Waits for the specified duration (`open_duration`).
     - **Service Call**: Plays the media on the selected speaker.

  ### Customization:

  - Replace `binary_sensor.garage_door_sensor` with your actual door sensor.
  - Adjust the `media_player.living_room_speaker` and file path as needed.
  - Use the `open_duration` variable in seconds or minutes (e.g., `60` for 1 minute).

  This automation can be easily modified to fit different doors and alert settings.
