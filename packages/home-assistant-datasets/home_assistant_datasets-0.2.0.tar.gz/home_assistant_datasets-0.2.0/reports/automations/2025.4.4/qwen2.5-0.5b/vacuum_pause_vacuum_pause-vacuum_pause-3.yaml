    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.
response: "Sure, let's create a blueprint for pausing the vacuum based on the phone\
  \ call sensor.\n\n### Components:\n1. **Phone Call Sensor**: This entity will detect\
  \ when there's a phone call coming in.\n2. **Vacuum Entity**: This entity is used\
  \ to pause the vacuum action and resume it manually.\n\n### Steps:\n\n#### 1. Define\
  \ the `binary_sensor` for the Phone Call\n```python\n# Define the binary sensor\
  \ for the phone call\nphone_call_sensor = BinarySensor('phone_call', 'Phone call\
  \ status')\n```\n\n#### 2. Register the `binary_sensor` with Home Assistant\n\n\
  This step registers the `phone_call_sensor` to be notified of changes in its state.\n\
  \n```python\ndef on_phone_call_sensor_state_change(call_button):\n    phone_call_sensor.state\
  \ = True\n    # Add any code here if you want to send a message or handle other\
  \ states after the change\n```\n\n#### 3. Define the Vacuum Entity\n```python\n\
  vacuum_entity = Vacuum()\n```\n\n#### 4. Register the `vacuum_entity` with Home\
  \ Assistant\n\nThis step registers the vacuum entity to be monitored and interacted\
  \ with by Home Assistant.\n\n```python\ndef on_vacuum_stop():\n    # Pause the vacuum\
  \ action (not stopped) if there's a call detected\n    if phone_call_sensor.state:\n\
  \        return False  # Return early, but continue processing other tasks\n\n \
  \   vacuum_entity.unpause()  # Resume the vacuum action after the pause\n\n# Add\
  \ any additional actions or logic here\n```\n\n#### 5. Register the main component\
  \ to handle changes\n```python\ndef on_main_component_removed(component_name):\n\
  \    pass\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n1. **Register the binary sensor**:\n   -\
  \ Create a new `binary_sensor` named \"phone_call\" and register it with Home Assistant.\n\
  \   - Add code to listen for changes in the `\"phone_call\"` state.\n\n2. **Define\
  \ your vacuum action**:\n   - Define a function that pauses the vacuum if there's\
  \ a call.\n\n3. **Register the vacuum entity**: \n   - Create a new `vacuum` entity\
  \ and register it with Home Assistant.\n   - Add code to pause the vacuum (`vacuum_entity.unpause()`).\n\
  \n4. **Add additional actions**:\n   - Depending on your application, add other\
  \ components or actions.\n\n5. **Handle changes in the system (main component removal)**:\n\
  \n   ```python\n   @main_component_removed\n   def on_main_component_removed(component_name):\n\
  \       pass\n   ```\n\n6. **Start monitoring and handling calls**:\n   - You can\
  \ start monitoring for phone calls using `phone_call_sensor` once the blueprint\
  \ is saved.\n   - Add code to call the action when a new phone call is received.\n\
  \n### Additional Notes:\n\n- This example provides a basic framework. Depending\
  \ on your specific requirements, you might need to adjust the actions and logic\
  \ accordingly.\n- You can extend this automation with additional features such as\
  \ automatic pauses during certain times of day or specific activities.\n\nRemember\
  \ to replace `\"phone_call\"`, `\"vacuum\"` with actual names relevant in your Home\
  \ Assistant configuration."
