    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  - name: "Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan"
    ambient:
      humidity_sensor: sensor1 or sensor2
      humidity_level: 60%
    entity_id: control.bathroom_exhaust_fan
  ```

  - example:

      - **Example 1: Bathroom Humidity Level**

          - This use case assumes that a humidty sensor named `sensor1` is attached to the `bathroom_exhaust_fan`.
          - The automation will turn on the fan when the humidity level in the bathroom exceeds 60%.

      - **Example 2: Garage Humidity Level**

          - This use case assumes that a humidty sensor named `sensor2` is attached to the `garage_exhaust_fan`.
          - The automation will turn off the fan when the humidity level in the garage drops below 60%.
          - If the sensor level is already at or above 60%, the automation will not attempt to turn it on.

      - **Example 3: Emergency Fan**

          - This example uses a `fan_entity` named `emergency_fan` and triggers the automation when the `sensor_level` drops below 59%.
          - The automation will stop the fan when the humidity level drops back above 60%.
