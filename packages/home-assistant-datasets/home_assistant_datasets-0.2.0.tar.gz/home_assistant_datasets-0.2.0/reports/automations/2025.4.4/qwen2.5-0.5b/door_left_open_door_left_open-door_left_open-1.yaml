    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  To create a blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is left open, follow these steps:

  1. **Navigate to `Entities > Door Sensors`:**
     - Select the door sensor from the `Entity Explorer` tab.

  2. **Create a Media Player:**
     - Create a new media player in the sidebar if you don't have one already.
     - Choose an appropriate music or podcast to play when the door is left open for 30 minutes.

  3. **Set Up Alert Media:**
     - Navigate back to the `Alerts` section in the sidebar.
     - Add a new alert with an `alert_id` and a media ID where you want to trigger the playback of the selected music player.
     - Adjust the duration for the audio file so it plays for 30 minutes or more.

  4. **Test Your Setup:**
     - Press the play button to test the automation setup by ensuring the door sensor triggers the alert when the door is open and has been left open for 30 minutes.

  Feel free to adjust the code snippet based on your specific requirements!
