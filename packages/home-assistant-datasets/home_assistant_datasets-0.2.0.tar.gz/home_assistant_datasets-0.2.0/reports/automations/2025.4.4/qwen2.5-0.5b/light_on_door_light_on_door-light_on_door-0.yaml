    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  To create an automation that turns on a light when the door opens using blueprint, follow these steps:

  1. Choose a `binary_sensor` for opening the door.
  2. Add one or more `light` entities to turn lights on/off.

  ### Using `door_switch`
  1. Select a `door_switch` (e.g., `sensor:door`) in your platform's dashboard.
  2. Add the light entity that you want to turn on when the door opens.
  3. Configure the automation so that turning the door switches it off and then turns the lights back on.

  ### Using `light`
  1. Select a `light` (e.g., `sensor:light`) in your platform's dashboard.
  2. Add an event handler for the opening of the door to trigger the automation.
  3. In the event handler, turn on the light when the door opens.

  This setup ensures that:

  - The light will turn on when the door opens.
  - If a timeout occurs (e.g., 2 minutes), the light will be off and turned back on after the specified time.
