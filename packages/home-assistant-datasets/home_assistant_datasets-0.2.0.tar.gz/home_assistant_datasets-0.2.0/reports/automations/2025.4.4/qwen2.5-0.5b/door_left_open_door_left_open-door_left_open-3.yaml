    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
response: "To create a blueprint that plays an alert on the speaker when the door\
  \ is left open, follow these steps:\n\n1. Add a `entity` selector: \n   - Select\
  \ a binary sensor (like \"door_sensor\") to detect if the door is open.\n\n2. Choose\
  \ a media player:\n   - Select a `media` entity type (like \"audio_player\" or \"\
  player\").\n\n3. Set the alert duration in the selector:\n   - For example, set\
  \ the `duration` selector to 5 minutes.\n\nNow, when you press the button that triggers\
  \ the automation:\n- The door will be left open.\n- A notification will play on\
  \ your speaker if the door is left open for more than 5 minutes."
