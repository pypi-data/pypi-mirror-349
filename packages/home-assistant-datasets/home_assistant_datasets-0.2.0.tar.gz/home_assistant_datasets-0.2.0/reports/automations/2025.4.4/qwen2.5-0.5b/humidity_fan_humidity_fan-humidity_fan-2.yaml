    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.
response: "To automate a fan based on humidity using a sensor in Home Assistant, we\
  \ can create a blueprint that listens for changes in the humidity sensor. We'll\
  \ use a `fan` entity to control the fan switch.\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\
  \n1. **Add the Sensor and Fan Components:**\n   - Add two entities:\n     - `sensor.humidity`:\
  \ A sensor component to measure the current humidity level.\n     - `fan.entity`:\
  \ An entity that will be used to turn on/off the fan based on the humidity level.\n\
  \n2. **Define the Blueprint:**\n\n```yaml\n# Blueprints.yaml\n\nblueprints:\n  #\
  \ Define blueprints for different use cases\n  - name: \"Humidity Fan\"\n    actions:\n\
  \      - name: \"Turn on fan when humidty is above 60%\"\n        entity_id: sensor.humidity\n\
  \n      - name: \"Stop fan when humidity level drops below 60%\"\n        action_id:\
  \ \n          type: \"stop_fan\"\n```\n\n### Detailed Description\n\n#### 1. Add\
  \ Sensor and Fan Components\n- We need two entities to measure the humidity levels:\n\
  \  - `sensor.humidity`: This sensor is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation.\n\
  \  - `fan.entity`: The entity that will control the fan switch.\n\n#### 2. Define\
  \ Blueprint\n- Create a blueprint with the following structure:\n\n```yaml\nblueprints:\n\
  \  - name: \"Humidity Fan\"\n    actions:\n      - name: \"Turn on fan when humidty\
  \ is above 60%\"\n        entity_id: sensor.humidity\n\n      - name: \"Stop fan\
  \ when humidity level drops below 60%\"\n        action_id: \n          type: \"\
  stop_fan\"\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Blueprint\n\n1. **Entities:**\n   - `sensor.humidity`:\
  \ This is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation.\n   - `fan.entity`: The\
  \ entity that will control the fan switch.\n\n2. **Actions:**\n   - We define two\
  \ actions:\n     - `\"Turn on fan when humidty is above 60%\"`: If the humidity\
  \ level goes above 60%, turn on the fan.\n     - `\"Stop fan when humidity level\
  \ drops below 60%\"`: Stop the fan if the humidity level goes below 60%.\n\n###\
  \ Example Use Cases\n\n1. **Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty\
  \ is above 60%:**\n   - When the sensor for the bathroom humidty measures at or\
  \ above 60%, the automation will turn on the fan.\n\n2. **Make sure the garage does\
  \ not get too humid:**\n   - When the sensor for the garage humidity level goes\
  \ below 60%, the automation should stop the fan, ensuring it doesn't disturb the\
  \ air quality of your garage.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This blueprint is a simple example\
  \ and can be expanded to handle more complex conditions.\n- You may need to adjust\
  \ the `fan_entity` to match the specific interface you are using with Home Assistant."
