    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: "To create a blueprint automation for turning lights on based on door opening\
  \ status, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Inputs:**\n   - `door_sensor`: A\
  \ `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.\n\n2. **Define Outputs:**\n\
  \   - The output should be a boolean value indicating whether the light is turned\
  \ on or off after the automation.\n\n3. **Set Up the Automation:**\n\n### 1. Add\
  \ an Input\nAdd a `binary_sensor` named `door_sensor`. This input will trigger when\
  \ the door opens.\n\n```yaml\nautomation:\n  - name: \"Turn on the pantry light\
  \ when the door opens\"\n    binary_sensor: \"door_sensor\"\n```\n\n### 2. Define\
  \ Outputs\n\n   Add an output to be triggered by the automation after the door has\
  \ been opened.\n   \n```yaml\noutput:\n  pantry_light_on: true  # True if the light\
  \ is turned on, False otherwise\n```\n \n### 3. Set Up the Automation\n\nThe blueprint\
  \ can now set up an `automation` section for this logic.\n\n```yaml\nautomations:\n\
  \  - name: \"Turn on the pantry light when the door opens\"\n    binary_sensor:\
  \ \"door_sensor\"   \n    output: \"pantry_light_on\"\n\n```\n\n### 4. Test the\
  \ Blueprint\n\n1. **Set Up the Door Sensor:**\n   On the Home Assistant console,\
  \ go to `Devices > Sensors` and select the `door_sensor`.\n\n2. **Test the Automation:**\n\
  \   Ensure that the light turns on when you turn your door open.\n\n### Example\
  \ Configuration\nAssuming your `door_sensor` is connected to a Raspberry Pi with\
  \ an `infrared` sensor:\n\n```yaml\nautomation:\n  - name: \"Turn on the pantry\
  \ light when the door opens\"\n    binary_sensor: \"door_sensor\"\n    output: \"\
  pantry_light_on\"\n\n```\n\nNow, whenever the door of your room opens (via a smart\
  \ home device or any other means), the automation will activate and turn on the\
  \ light inside the pantry."
