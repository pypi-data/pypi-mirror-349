    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Sure! Below is an example blueprint in YAML that accomplishes what you're asking for:

  ```yaml
  # Define entities
  door_sensor:
    type: binary_sensor

  light_switches:
    - name: "Door opens light"
      entity_id: light

  - name: "Do not open door light"
    entity_id: light

  ```

  ### Explanation:
  1. **door_sensor**: A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to turn on the lights when the door opens.
  2. **light_switches**: One or more `light` entities targets to turn on or off the lights when the automation fires.

  In this blueprint, the `door_sensor` is a binary sensor that detects whether the door is open or closed.
  The automation will start by turning on the lights if the door opens.

  ### Example Use Cases:
  - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens.
  - When you close the door or turn off your phone, the lights should come on automatically.

  You can use this blueprint in Home Assistant to automate actions based on door opening status and specific actions (like turning off lights) triggered by the automation.
