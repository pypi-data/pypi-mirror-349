    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
response: "To create a blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the\
  \ door is left open, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. **Define the Door Sensor**:\
  \ \n   - Add a `binary_sensor` entity selector called \"door_sensor\" that monitors\
  \ the status of the door.\n\n2. **Configure Media Player**:\n   - Create a new media\
  \ player entity using the same `entity_id`.\n   - Use an alert media selector with\
  \ the provided parameters: duration (30 minutes), and the music ID from the selected\
  \ media player.\n\nHere's the code to set up this automation:\n\n```yaml\n# The\
  \ following will be replaced by your own actual details:\nlighting:\n  devices:\n\
  \    - entity_id: door_sensor\n      state: closed\n\nautomations:\n  main:\n  \
  \  - action: play_media\n      selector: audio_play_action\n      media:\n     \
  \   - entity_id: music_player\n          music_id: \"music_id\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\
  \n- **`lighting`:** \n  - The `door_sensor` is a `binary_sensor` that monitors the\
  \ status of the door.\n  \n- **`automations`:**\n  - This section defines a main\
  \ automation. An automatic action with an `action: play_media` selects the audio\
  \ player (music_player) using the provided `media` selector.\n  - The `selector:\
  \ audio_play_action` indicates that the action is played on the audio player.\n\n\
  ### Example:\n- If the door has been left open for more than 30 minutes, the automation\
  \ will start playing the sound.\n  \nRemember to replace `\"music_id\"` with the\
  \ actual ID of your media player. This example assumes you have a music player in\
  \ mind already; if not, you can create one using `homeassistant.components.media_player`.\n\
  \  \nThis setup is just an example and should be adapted according to the specific\
  \ details and capabilities of the automation system you are using."
