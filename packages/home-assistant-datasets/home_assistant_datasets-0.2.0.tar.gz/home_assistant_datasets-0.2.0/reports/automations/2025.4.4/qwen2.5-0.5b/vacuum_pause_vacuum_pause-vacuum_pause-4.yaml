    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.
response: |-
  ```yaml
  automations:
    - id: "pause_vacuum_when_phone_call"
      name: "Pause Vacuum When Phone Call"
      short_description: "Pause the vacuum when a phone call is received."
      description: """
        The automation will pause the vacuum when a phone call is received.
        It can be set to pause automatically or manually, and it should stop the current
        running vacuum and start pausing it based on the triggered event.
      """
      dependencies:
        - "binary_sensor"
  ```

  ### Explanation:

  - **automations**: A list of automation definitions. Each automation has a unique ID, an explanation for it in plain text, a short description (e.g., "Pause Vacuum When Phone Call"), and a detailed description in YAML format.

  - **dependency**: Defines the dependency on two entities: `binary_sensor` and `vacuum`. The `binary_sensor` is responsible for triggering the automation when a phone call is received.

  ### Example Use Cases:

  1. **Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives**:
     - Add an instance of `binary_sensor` with the `phone_call_sensor` ID.
     - Add another instance of `vacuum` to pause the vacuum.
     - Set up the blueprint configuration, and you will see the vacuum paused automatically.

  2. **Don't interrupt your work video call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts**:
     - If the call is already in progress, the automation should not be triggered.
     - Add an instance of `binary_sensor` with the `phone_call_sensor` ID and another instance of `vacuum` to pause the vacuum.
     - Set up the blueprint configuration.
