    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.
response: |-
  To create a blueprint for turning on the fan based on the humidity sensor's value:

  1. First, add a `sensor` entity for the humidty sensor (`humidity_sensor`) that triggers the automation.
  2. Next, configure an `entity_data` to store the current humidity level:
     - Set up a `number_entity` and specify its name (`humidity_level`).
     - Create an `update_every` of 10 seconds (to ensure every second) so that it updates as needed.
  3. Then, add an `action` with two inputs:
      - `value`: The current humidity level, which is given in percentage.
      - `action`: A button or action that turns on the fan when its value exceeds the `humidity_level`.

     ```yaml
     # Humidity Fan
     - entity_id: sensor.humidity_sensor
       name: "Humidity Sensor"
       polling_frequency: 10s

     - number_entity:
        name: humidity_level
        value_template: "{{ data('sensor.humidity_sensor') }}"
        update_every: 10s
     ```

  4. Finally, connect the `action` to a button or action that triggers the automation:

  ```yaml
  - entity_id: fan
    name: "Fan"
    method: "on"
    trigger_entity_id: humidity_level
  ```

  This blueprint sets up an automation that starts the fan if the humidty sensor detects an above average level, stops it when it goes below the desired level, and only turns it back on when its value is within acceptable limits.
