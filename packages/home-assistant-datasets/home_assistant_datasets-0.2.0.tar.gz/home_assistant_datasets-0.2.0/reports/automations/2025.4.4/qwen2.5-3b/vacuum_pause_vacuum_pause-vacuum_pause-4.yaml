    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.
response: |-
  ```plaintext
  Trigger: State change of phone_call_sensor to state=ON

  Action:
    - Service call:
      - Entity ID: vacuum_entity
      - Service: vacuum.pause
  ```

  This blueprint listens for the `phone_call_sensor` binary sensor to transition from an OFF (not receiving a call) to ON (a call is received). When this happens, it triggers a service call on the `vacuum_entity` to pause. The vacuum remains paused rather than stopped so it can be resumed manually if needed.
