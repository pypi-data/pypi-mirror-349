    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: DoorLeftOpenAlert
      trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: $door_sensor
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: $door_sensor
          state: "on"
        - condition: duration
          entity_id: $door_sensor
          to_state: "off"
          for: $open_duration
      action:
        - media_play:
            entity_id: $alert_media
  ```

  This automation triggers when a door sensor (specified by `$door_sensor`) is in the 'on' state and then within `$open_duration` time, it transitions back to 'off'. It plays the selected alert (`$alert_media`).
