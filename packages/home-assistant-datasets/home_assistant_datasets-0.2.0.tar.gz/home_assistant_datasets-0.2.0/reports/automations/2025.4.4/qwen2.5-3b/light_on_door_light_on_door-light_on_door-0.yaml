    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

  Here is a simple blueprint for your requirement:

  ```yaml
  automation: turn_on_when_door_opens
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.pantry_door
      to: on

  condition:
    condition: state
    entity_id: light.pantry_light
    target_state: off

  action:
    - service: switch.turn_on
      data:
        entity_id: light.pantry_light

  reinitialize_after: 120 # Turn off after 2 minutes
  ```

  In this blueprint, the `binary_sensor` for the door and `light` are used. When the door is detected to be open (`state: on`), it triggers a condition check if the `pantry_light` is currently off. If so, it turns the light on. After 120 seconds (2 minutes), regardless of whether the door was still open or not, the automation reinitializes and turns the light off.

  Make sure to replace `binary_sensor.pantry_door`, `light.pantry_light` with your actual entity IDs.
