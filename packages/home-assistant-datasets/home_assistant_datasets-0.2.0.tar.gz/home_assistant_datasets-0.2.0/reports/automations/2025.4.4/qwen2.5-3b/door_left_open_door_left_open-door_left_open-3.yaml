    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
response: |-
  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: DoorOpenAlert
      trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: [door_sensor.entity]
        to: "on"
      condition:
        condition: state
        entity_id: door_sensor.entity
        target: "off"
        for: "{{ states.door_sensor.entity.state_attributes.open_duration }}"
      action:
        service: media_player.play_media
        data:
          media_content_id: "{{ alert_media }}"
  ```

  This blueprint assumes you have a `binary_sensor` named `door_sensor` and a `media_player` configured as `alert_media`. The duration is dynamically set based on the attribute `open_duration` from the state of `door_sensor.entity`.

  Please adjust the entity names (`door_sensor`, `alert_media`) according to your setup.
