    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.
response: |-
  ```plaintext
  -trigger: phone_call_sensor.state equals "on"
  -action:
    - service: vacuum.pause_entity
      data_template:
        entity_id: "{{ trigger.to_state.entity_id }}"
  ```

  This blueprint sets up an automation that pauses a running vacuum when the binary sensor (`phone_call_sensor`) indicates a call is in progress. The vacuum's `pause_entity` (typically a vacuum-specific service like `vacuum: pause`) is used to pause the vacuum. When the call ends, you can manually resume the vacuum if needed.
