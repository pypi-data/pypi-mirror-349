    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.
response: |-
  ```plaintext
  # Vacuum Pause Automation

  Trigger:
  - When a phone call is received (`phone_call_sensor` triggers)

  Action(s):
  - If `vacuum_entity` is currently running, pause it.

  Inputs:
  - `phone_call_sensor`: A binary sensor entity indicating if a phone call has been received.
  - `vacuum_entity`: The vacuum device to be paused when the automation triggers.

  Note: When triggered, the vacuum should not be stopped completely but paused (keeping the vacuum on), allowing manual resume.
