    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
response: |-
  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: "Door Left Open Alert"
      trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: "{{trigger.entity_id}}"
          to: "on"
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: "{{trigger.entity_id}}"
          state: "off"
      action:
        - service: media_player.turn_on
          data:
            entity_id: '{{alert_media}}'
        - service: notify.notify
          data:
            message: "Door left open for {{open_duration.value.hours|round|int}} hours."
  ```

  This automation will trigger when a door sensor (`door_sensor`) transitions to the 'on' state (indicating it is open), and only if it was previously in an 'off' state. It then turns on a specified media player (`alert_media`) and notifies with a message indicating how long the door has been left open based on the `open_duration` value.
  Please replace `{{trigger.entity_id}}`, `{{alert_media}}`, and adjust the message template as needed to fit your setup.
