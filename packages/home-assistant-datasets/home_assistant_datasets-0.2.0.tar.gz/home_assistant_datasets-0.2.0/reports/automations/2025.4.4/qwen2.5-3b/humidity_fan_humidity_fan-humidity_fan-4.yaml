    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: FanOnWhenHumidityHigh
      trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: humidity_sensor.bathroom_humidity
        to: 'above {{ states.humidity_level.state }}'
      condition:
        condition: state
        entity_id: fan.bathroom_fan
        state: off
      action:
        service: fan.turn_on
        data_input:
          entity_id: fan.bathroom_fan
      mode: single
  ```

  This automation turns on the specified bathroom fan when the humidity sensor's value exceeds the set level. It ensures that the fan is turned off when it has already been turned on and is turned off when its state changes to 'off'.
