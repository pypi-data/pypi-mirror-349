    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: DoorLeftOpenAlert
      trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.your_door_sensor
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.your_door_sensor

      action:
        - media_player.play_media:

            media_type: sound
        - delay:
            seconds: "{{ states.binary_sensor.your_door_sensor.last_changed | from_iso_string | ago | int }} + 1800"
  ```

  Replace `your_door_sensor` with the actual entity ID of your door sensor, and `your_alert_sound_media_id` with the actual media content ID for the sound you want to play. This automation assumes a delay of 30 minutes (1800 seconds) before playing the alert if the door remains open.

  If using Home Assistant Core's default sounds, you can find sound IDs in `/usr/share/sounds/notifications/*.xml`. Replace `binary_sensor.your_door_sensor.last_changed` with your actual sensor.
