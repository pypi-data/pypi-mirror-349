    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here's a blueprint for your scenario:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: PauseVacuumOnPhoneCall
      trigger:
        - platform: event
          event_type: binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor.changed
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: phone_call_sensor
          target_state: "on"
      action:
        - service: vacuum.pause
          data:
            entity_id: vacuum.vacuum_entity
  ```

  Replace `phone_call_sensor` with the actual sensor name that triggers when a call is received, and replace `vacuum.vacuum_entity` with the actual vacuum cleaner entity in your system.
