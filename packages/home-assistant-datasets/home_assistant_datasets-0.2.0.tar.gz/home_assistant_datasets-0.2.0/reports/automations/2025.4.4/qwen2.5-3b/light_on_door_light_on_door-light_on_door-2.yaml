    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

  Title: Turn On Light When Door Opens

  ### Inputs:
  - `door_sensor`: A binary sensor that indicates whether the door is open or closed.
  - `light_switch`: One or more light entities to turn on and off.

  ### Configuration:

  ```yaml
  automation:
    - alias: TurnOnLightWhenDoorOpens
      trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: 'door_sensor'
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: 'door_sensor'
          state: 'on'
      action:
        - service: light.turn_on
          data:
            entity_id: 'light_switch'
        - delay
          seconds: 120 # Wait for 2 minutes before shutting off the light
  ```

  ### Explanation:

  - **Trigger:** The automation starts when the door sensor changes state from closed to open.
  - **Condition:** The condition checks if the door is in an "on" state (open).
  - **Action:** When the door opens, it turns on the specified light. After a 120-second delay, it turns off the light.

  ### Example Use Cases:

  - Turn on pantry lights when the pantry door opens.
  - Turn on living room lights when the main entrance door opens.

  ### Notes:
  - Ensure that `light_switch` is correctly set to your desired light entities (e.g., 'living_room_light', 'pantry_light').
  - The delay ensures a safe transition for any automated systems or sensors connected to these lights.
