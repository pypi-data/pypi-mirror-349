    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here's a simple blueprint for Home Assistant that accomplishes this:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Vacuum Pause on Phone Call
    description: An automation to pause your vacuum when you receive a phone call.
  inputs:
    phone_call_sensor:
      selector:
        entity:
          domain: binary_sensor
          integration: 'zero'
    vacuum_entity:
      selector:
        entity:
          domain: vacuum

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: '{{ inputs.phone_call_sensor }}'
      to: 'on'

  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: '{{ inputs.vacuum_entity }}'
      state: 'cleaning'

  action:
    - service: vacuum.pause
      target:
        entity_id: '{{ inputs.vacuum_entity }}'
  ```

  This blueprint will pause the specified vacuum when a phone call is detected by the sensor, but only if the vacuum was in the `cleaning` state. This avoids trying to pause the vacuum if it wasn't running to begin with.
