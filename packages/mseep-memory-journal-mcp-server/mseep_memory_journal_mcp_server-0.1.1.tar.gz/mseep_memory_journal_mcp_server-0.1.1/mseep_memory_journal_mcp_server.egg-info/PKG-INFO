## 🚀 Getting started

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have macOS with a Photos library.
2. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage dependencies and run the server.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siddhant-K-code/memory-journal-mcp-server.git
   cd memory-journal-mcp-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies using `uv`:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Configure the MCP server. Update your `claude_desktop_config.json` with the following configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "smart-photo-journal": {
         "command": "/Users/<YOUR_DEVICE_USERNAME>/.local/bin/uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/Users/<PATH_TO_CLONED_DIR>/memory-journal-mcp-server",
           "run",
           "server.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Start the server with following command or just open Claude Desktop:
   ```bash
   uv run server.py
   ```

> **Note:** Replace `<YOUR_DEVICE_USERNAME>` and `<PATH_TO_CLONED_DIR>` with your actual device username and the path to the cloned directory.
> You will get a popup to authorize the server to access your photos. It will be in local only, and no data will be shared with anyone except Claude services.
