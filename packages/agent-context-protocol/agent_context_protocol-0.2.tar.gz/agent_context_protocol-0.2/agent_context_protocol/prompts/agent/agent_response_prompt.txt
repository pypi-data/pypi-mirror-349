### Your Task:

1. Analyze the TOOL Response for the Current Step:
   - Verify if the TOOL response is plausible, relevant, and complete based on the expectations from the current step.
   - Determine if the response contains the necessary information to fulfill the Output Variables specified in the Step Details.

2. Process and Extract Data for the Current Step:
   - Extract the relevant information from the TOOL response to create the Output Variables for the current step.
   - Format the data according to the expected data type (e.g., JSON, Array, String).
   - Ensure the data is presentable and suitable for display or further processing. Include important information like units or additional context based on TOOL documentation, so that it is easy to understand.

3. Assess and Fulfill Dependencies:
   - Identify any dependent steps that rely on the output of the current step.
   - Determine if the TOOL response contains sufficient information to fulfill the Input Variables required by the dependent steps.
   - Extract and format the necessary data for each dependent step's Input Variables, matching the expected data types and formats.
   - Include important information like units or additional context based on TOOL documentation, so that it is easy to understand.

4. Handle Errors Appropriately:
   - 605 INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION: Raise this error if most or all of the information is missing, and the TOOL response is insufficient to fill in the Output_Variables or Dependent_Input_Variables.
   - 606 DEPENDENCY_INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION: Raise this error if most or all of the information is missing for dependent steps, and the TOOL response lacks sufficient information to fulfill the dependencies for future steps.
   - 607 WRONG_INFORMATION: Raise this error if the TOOL output is not at all related to what was intended. This error should be raised very rarely when everything is wrong.
   - Only raise errors in extreme cases when the missing information is significant.
   - When an error is raised, do not include Output_Variables or Dependent_Input_Variables after the Error_Explanation.

5. Output the Processed Data:
   - Provide a CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT where you document your reasoning and the steps taken to process the data.
   - Present the TOOL_RESPONSE including:
     - Status_Code: Indicate the status code and status text.
     - Output_Variables: Provide the processed output variables for the current step.
     - Dependent_Input_Variables: Provide the processed data for dependent steps' input variables.

6. Maintain Strict Adherence to the Output Format:
   - Do not include additional details or change the structure.
   - Ensure clarity and correctness in variable names, data types, and content.
   - Use valid JSON format where applicable.

7. Filling in the Output_Variables and Dependent_Input_Variables:
   - Try to include all the important information about the output in the respective output variables or the dependent input variables. For example, if you are mentioning quantities, then include their units.
   - Ensure the extracted values contain all the context needed to be understandable and complete.
   - Completely extract the important information from the TOOL output and fill in the output variables fully. Do not miss out on important parts of the TOOL output.

### Important Guidelines:

  - Begin by evaluating if the TOOL response contains the information needed for the current step.
  - Extract and format the relevant data for the Output Variables.
  - Next, assess whether the TOOL response provides the necessary information for dependent steps.
  - Extract and format the required data for each dependent step's Input Variables.
  - Think about what information from the TOOL output should be extracted so that things are understandable and complete.
  - Utilize the TOOL documentation present in the chat history.
  - Incorporate considerations about error handling: only raise errors (605, 606, 607) in extreme cases when missing information is significant or when the TOOL response is entirely incorrect.
  - Include important information like units or additional context based on TOOL documentation, so that it is easy to understand standalone.

- Error Handling:
  - 605 INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION: Raise this error if most or all of the information is missing, and the TOOL response is insufficient for the current step.
  - 606 DEPENDENCY_INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION: Raise this error if most or all of the information is missing for dependent steps.
  - 607 WRONG_INFORMATION: Raise this error if the TOOL response is not at all related to what was intended. This error should be raised very rarely when everything is wrong.
  - Provide a clear explanation in the Error_Explanation section.
  - Only raise errors in extreme cases, not for minor or partial data issues.
  - When an error is raised, do not include Output_Variables or Dependent_Input_Variables after the Error_Explanation.

- Data Validation and Formatting:
  - Ensure all extracted data matches the expected data types and formats specified.
  - For lists or multiple items, use appropriate data structures to organize the data.
  - Validate that all required fields are present and correctly formatted.

- No Additional Explanations:
  - Do not include apologies, justifications, or any text outside the specified output format.
  - Keep the output concise and strictly adhere to the format.

Your Output:

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

Step 1: Evaluate TOOL Responses for Current Step

- The `vacation_spots_list` contains the following locations:
  1. "Rome, Italy"
  2. "Venice, Italy"
  3. "Prague, Czech Republic"
  4. "Dubrovnik, Croatia"
  5. "Barcelona, Spain"

Step 2: Analyze Each TOOL Response

- TOOL Response for "Rome, Italy":
  - The `data` field contains:
    - Title: "<b>Rome</b>"
    - geoId: 187791
    - Region: "Lazio, Italy"
  - Information is sufficient for our needs.

- TOOL Response for "Venice, Italy":
  - The `data` field contains:
    - Title: "<b>Venice</b>"
    - geoId: 187870
    - Region: "Veneto, Italy"
  - Information is sufficient.

- TOOL Response for "Prague, Czech Republic":
  - The `data` field contains:
    - Title: "<b>Prague</b>"
    - geoId: 274707
    - Region: "Bohemia, Czech Republic"
  - Information is sufficient.

- TOOL Response for "Dubrovnik, Croatia":
  - The `data` field is empty (`[]`).
  - No location details available for Dubrovnik.
  - Since only one location is missing and most data is available, we will proceed without raising an error.

- TOOL Response for "Barcelona, Spain":
  - The `data` field contains:
    - Title: "<b>Barcelona</b>"
    - geoId: 187497
    - Region: "Catalonia, Spain"
  - Information is sufficient.

Step 3: Extract and Format Data for Output Variables

- For each location with available data, extract:
  - Cleaned Title (remove HTML tags like `<b>` and `</b>`)
  - geoId
  - Region (`secondaryText`)

- Processed Data:
  - Rome:
    - Title: "Rome"
    - geoId: 187791
    - Region: "Lazio, Italy"
  - Venice:
    - Title: "Venice"
    - geoId: 187870
    - Region: "Veneto, Italy"
  - Prague:
    - Title: "Prague"
    - geoId: 274707
    - Region: "Bohemia, Czech Republic"
  - Barcelona:
    - Title: "Barcelona"
    - geoId: 187497
    - Region: "Catalonia, Spain"

Step 4: Assess Dependencies

- Dependent Input Variable: `location_geoId` for sub_task 1, Step 3.
- We have `geoId` for four locations.
- These `geoId` values can be used in the next step to retrieve hotel options.

Step 5: Decide on Error Handling

- Only one location is missing (`Dubrovnik, Croatia`).
- As most of the information is available, and missing data is minimal, we will not raise an error.
- Proceed to provide the extracted details for the available locations.

- I will make sure to include any units if relevant.

Current Step Details:

- TOOL: TripadvisorSearchLocation
- Handles: Fetches location details for each vacation spot
- Input Variables:
  - Name: vacation_spots_list
    - Parameter: query
    - Type: string
    - Source: TOOL_Output (sub_task 1, Step 1)
    - Description: List of vacation spots from Perplexity
    - Value: "["Dubrovnik, Croatia"]"
- Output Variables:
  - Name: location_details
    - Description: Location details for each vacation spot

Dependent Input Variables Step:


TOOL Response 0:

{'status': True, 'message': 'Success', 'timestamp': 1728027711206, 'data': []}

Your Output:

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

Step 1: Evaluate TOOL Responses for Current Step

- The `vacation_spots_list` contains: "Dubrovnik, Croatia".

Step 2: Analyze Each TOOL Response

- TOOL Response for "Dubrovnik, Croatia":
  - The `data` field is empty (`[]`).
  - No location details are available for Dubrovnik, Croatia.

Step 3: Extract and Format Data for Output Variables

- Since the data is empty, we cannot extract any location details.
- The Output Variable `location_details` cannot be filled.

Step 4: Assess Dependencies

- There may be dependent steps that rely on `location_details`.
- Without location details, we cannot fulfill any dependent Input Variables.

Step 5: Decide on Error Handling

- All information is missing for the current step.
- As per guidelines, when most or all information is missing, we should raise an error.
- Therefore, we will raise 605 INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION.

- I will make sure to include any units if relevant.

$$AGENT_RESPONSE$$

Status_Code

605 INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION

Error_Explanation

The TOOL response does not provide the geoID for Dubrovnik, Croatia. Thus the response remains totally incomplete.

- The TOOL responses provide current weather data for each of the specified rainy areas.
- Each response includes the necessary weather details such as temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and weather code, along with units (which are mentioned in the TOOL output as well as the TOOL documentation previously).
- The data is complete and matches the expected output for the current step, which is to retrieve current weather conditions for each area.
- The extracted data will be formatted into a JSON structure for the output variable `current_weather_data`.
- I will make sure to include any units if relevant.

Your Output:

$$CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT$$

Step 1: Evaluate the TOOL Response

-The TOOL response provides real-time weather data for “Washington.” However, upon examining the location details, the country is listed as “Aruba” instead of “USA.”
- We expected the weather for Washington, D.C., USA, as per the input variable “cTOOLtal_city_name,” but the TOOL returned data for a location in a completely different country.

Step 2: Assess Dependencies

- There are dependent steps that rely on the correct weather data for Washington, D.C., specifically in the USA. Since the country is wrong in the TOOL response, it will mislead the dependent steps, which require accurate weather conditions for suggesting relevant activities.

Step 3: Decide on Error Handling

- Although we generally avoid raising errors unless the discrepancy is significant, in this case, the TOOL has returned weather information for an entirely different country. This makes the data completely inaccurate for our purposes.
- Given that the issue is not a minor difference (like a wrong time or small temperature variance), but a country mismatch, it severely impacts the dependent steps’ ability to provide accurate results.
- As per the guidelines, when the TOOL response contains entirely wrong information, we raise error code 607 WRONG_INFORMATION.
- Therefore, in this case, we will raise the error because the response is unrelated to the intended input location, Washington, D.C., USA.
- I will make sure to include any units if relevant.

$$AGENT_RESPONSE$$

Status_Code

607 WRONG_INFORMATION

Error_Explanation

The TOOL response is wrong as it does gave us the weather for Washington in country Aruba, but we wanted the weather in Washington DC, USA
