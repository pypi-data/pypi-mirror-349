# 🚀 DevTrack CLI

> 🛠️ DevTrack is a lightweight developer productivity CLI tool for tracking tasks and generating meaningful Git commit messages (AI-powered) without leaving the terminal. It works both online (via OpenRouter) and offline (via Ollama).

---

## ✨ Why DevTrack?

Modern developers juggle dozens of tasks daily — but Git alone doesn’t track the **why** behind each change.

🔹 Project managers use Jira.  
🔹 Designers use Figma.  
🔹 Developers use… their memory?

**DevTrack** fills the gap by giving you a developer-first micro-task tracker that lives right in your terminal.

- 🧠 Track your current focus  
- 📝 Generate structured commit messages  
- 🐢 Avoid messy, vague Git history  
- 💻 Stay in flow — no switching tabs or opening heavy tools  

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add, list, and remove tasks
- 🧠 Generate smart commit messages based on task description and git diff
- 🌐 Supports OpenRouter and Ollama for online/offline usage
- 📁 Stores tasks locally in `.devtrack.json`
- 🖥️ Runs from the terminal as `devtrack <command>`

---

## 🔧 Installation

### Clone and install locally (editable mode)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrdegbe/devtrack.git
cd devtrack
pip install -e .
````
---
## 📌 Usage

### ➕ Add a Task

```bash
devtrack add "Write unit tests"
```



### 📋 List Tasks

```bash
devtrack tasks
```


### 🗑️ Remove a task

```bash
devtrack remove <task_id>
```

### 📦 Commit with Task

```bash
devtrack commit <task_id>
```
Commits with AI-generated commit message.
Git must be initialized and have clean staging for this to work.

### 📊 View Summary

```bash
devtrack summary
```

Shows completed task stats.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

* Tasks are stored locally in `~/.devtrack.json`
* Each task has an ID, description, tag, and completion status
* Git commits are generated using task data
* Keeps your Git history meaningful and linked to your actual progress
