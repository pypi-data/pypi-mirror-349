## v0.3.0 (2025-02-24)

- Handle bare `ClassVar` type qualifiers, rename `INFERRED` sentinel by @Viicos in [#26](https://github.com/pydantic/typing-inspection/pull/26)
  While currently not explicitly allowed by the typing specification, `ClassVar` is allowed as a bare type qualifier.
  Unlike `Final`, the actual type doesn't have to be inferred from the assignment (e.g. one can use `Any`).
  For this reason, the `INFERRED` sentinel was renamed to `UNKNOWN`.
