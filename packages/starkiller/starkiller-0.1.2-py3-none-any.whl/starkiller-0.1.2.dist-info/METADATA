# Starkiller

[![CI status](https://github.com/kompoth/starkiller/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kompoth/starkiller/actions)

**Work in progress**

An import refactoring package and [python-lsp-server](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server) plugin.
Starkiller aims to be static, i.e. to analyse source code without actually executing it, and fast, thanks to built-in
`ast` module.

The initial goal was to create a simple linter to get rid of star imports, hence the choice of the package name.

## Using as a package

Starkiller can be used as a package for import refactoring. Each public method and class has a docstring explaining
what it does and how to use it.

## Python LSP Server plugin

The `pylsp` plugin provides the following code actions to refactor import statements:

- `Replace * with explicit names` - suggested for `from ... import *` statements. 
- `Replace * import with module import` - suggested for `from ... import *` statements. 
- `Replace from import with module import` - suggested for `from ... import ...` statements.
- `Replace module import with from import` - suggested for `import ...` statements.
- `Remove unnecessary import` - suggested for `import` statements with unused names. 

To enable the plugin install Starkiller in the same virtual environment as `python-lsp-server` with `[pylsp]` optional
dependency. E.g., with `pipx`: 

```bash
pipx inject python-lsp-server starkiller[pylsp]
```

The plugin is enabled just the same way as any other `pylsp` plugin. E.g., in Neovim via
[lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig):

```lua
require("lspconfig").pylsp.setup {
    settings = {
        pylsp = {
            plugins = {
                starkiller = { enabled = true },
                aliases = {
                    numpy = "np",
                    [ "matplotlib.pyplot" ] = "plt",
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Comma separated package imports

Multiple package imports like in the following example do not trigger any Code Actions right now:

```python
import os, sys
```

This is hard to understand which import the user wants to fix here: `os`, `sys` or both. Splitting imports to different
lines would help, but the user has to do it manually or with some other tool like [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).
Starkiller is not a code formatter and should not handle import splitting.

At some point this might change. For example, a separate Code Action for each package could be suggested.

## Alternatives and inspiration

- [removestar](https://www.asmeurer.com/removestar/) is a [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes) based tool with
similar objectives.
- [SurpriseDog's scripts](https://github.com/SurpriseDog/Star-Wrangler) are a great source of inspiration.
- `pylsp` itself has a built-in `rope_autoimport` plugin utilizing [Rope](https://github.com/python-rope/rope)'s
`autoimport` module.
