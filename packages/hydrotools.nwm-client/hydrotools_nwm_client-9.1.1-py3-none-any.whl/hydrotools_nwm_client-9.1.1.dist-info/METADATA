              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# OWPHydroTools :: NWM Client

This subpackage implements various interfaces to retrieve National Water Model (NWM) data from various sources including Google Cloud Platform, NOMADS, local directories, or a generic web server directory listing. The primary use for this tool is to populate `pandas.Dataframe` objects with NWM streamflow data. See the [NWM Client Documentation](https://noaa-owp.github.io/hydrotools/hydrotools.nwm_client.html) for a complete list and description of the currently available methods. To report bugs or request new features, submit an issue through the [OWPHydroTools Issue Tracker](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/hydrotools/issues) on GitHub.

## Installation

In accordance with the python community, we support and advise the usage of virtual
environments in any workflow using python. In the following installation guide, we
use python's built-in `venv` module to create a virtual environment in which the
tool will be installed. Note this is just personal preference, any python virtual
environment manager should work just fine (`conda`, `pipenv`, etc. ).

```bash
# Create and activate python environment, requires python >= 3.8
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel

# Install nwm_client
$ python3 -m pip install hydrotools.nwm_client
```

## Usage

The following example demonstrates how one might use `hydrotools.nwm_client` to retrieve NWM streamflow forecasts.

### Code

<details><summary><b>View compatible configurations</b></summary>

```python
# Import the NWM Client
from hydrotools.nwm_client.NWMFileClient import NWMFileClient

# Instantiate model data client
model_data_client = NWMFileClient()

# Print compatible model configurations
#  Note that not all data sources contain the full range of available 
#  National Water Model data. This client defaults to Google Cloud Platform
#  Which has the largest amount of *operational* forecast data.
#  Also note that not all configurations are available for the entire
#  archive of NWM operational forecast data. For example, the configurations 
#  for Alaska only became available after August 2023.
print(model_data_client.catalog.configurations)
```
### Example output
```console
['analysis_assim', 'analysis_assim_alaska', 'analysis_assim_alaska_no_da', 'analysis_assim_extend', 'analysis_assim_extend_no_da', 'analysis_assim_extend_alaska', 'analysis_assim_extend_alaska_no_da', 'analysis_assim_hawaii', 'analysis_assim_hawaii_no_da', 'analysis_assim_no_da', 'analysis_assim_puertorico', 'analysis_assim_puertorico_no_da', 'analysis_assim_long', 'analysis_assim_long_no_da', 'long_range_mem1', 'long_range_mem2', 'long_range_mem3', 'long_range_mem4', 'medium_range_alaska_mem1', 'medium_range_alaska_mem2', 'medium_range_alaska_mem3', 'medium_range_alaska_mem4', 'medium_range_alaska_mem5', 'medium_range_alaska_mem6', 'medium_range_alaska_no_da', 'medium_range_mem1', 'medium_range_mem2', 'medium_range_mem3', 'medium_range_mem4', 'medium_range_mem5', 'medium_range_mem6', 'medium_range_mem7', 'medium_range_no_da', 'short_range', 'short_range_alaska', 'short_range_hawaii', 'short_range_hawaii_no_da', 'short_range_puertorico', 'short_range_puertorico_no_da']
```

# Instantiate model data client
#  By default, NWM values are in SI units
#  If you prefer US standard units, nwm_client can return
#  values in US standard units by setting the unit_system parameter 
#  to MeasurementUnitSystem.US
# 
# from hydrotools.nwm_client.NWMClientDefaults import MeasurementUnitSystem

### System Requirements
We employ several methods to make sure the resulting `pandas.DataFrame` produced by `nwm_client` are as efficient and manageable as possible. Nonetheless, this package can potentially use a large amount of memory.

The National Water Model generates multiple forecasts per day at over 3.7 million locations across the United States. A single forecast could be spread across hundreds of files and require repeated calls to the data source. The intermediate steps of retrieving and processing these files into leaner `DataFrame` may use several GB of memory. As such, recommended minimum requirements to use this package are a 4-core consumer processor and 8 GB of RAM.

## Development

This package uses a setup configuration file (`setup.cfg`) and assumes use of the `setuptools` backend to build the package. To install the package for development use:
```bash
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install -U pip
$ python3 -m pip install -U setuptools
$ python3 -m pip install -e .[develop]
```

To generate a source distribution:
```bash
$ python3 -m pip install -U wheel build
$ python3 -m build
```

The packages generated in `dist/` can be installed directly with `pip` or uploaded to PyPI using `twine`.
