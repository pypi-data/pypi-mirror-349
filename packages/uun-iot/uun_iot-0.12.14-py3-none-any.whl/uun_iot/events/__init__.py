Library events are defined in this module. Below is an overview of existing
events and general information regarding subscriptions to events.

================= =======================================================================
    event                   description
================= =======================================================================
 ``EvTick``        timer has ticked (timer configured in JSON config)
 ``EvStart``       app has started (via :meth:`~Gateway.start`)
 ``EvStop``        app is stopping, please end module's action as soon as possible
 ``EvExternal``    a registered command was issued using socket IPC
 ``EvConfUpdate``  gateway's configuration was updated
================= =======================================================================

Event subscriptions:

    Event handlers in classes (user modules) are registered by storing
    additional information together with the class's method, using
    corresponding `@<event>.subscribe`. This information includes event type
    and possibly additional information needed to identify the handler.

    This information is then collected from all passed instances using
    :func:`attach_handlers` and events with registered handlers are returned.
    There, appropriate events are created and the corresponding handlers are
    registered to corresponding events.

Advanced handler extraction:

    Alternatively, the :func:`attach_handlers` can register handlers to already
    existing events. You can even define your own events! See
    :func:`attach_handlers` for technical details.

Custom events:

    If you want to define your own events independently from this library, the
    only requirement is to subclass from the :class:`Event` class in order to
    be consistend with existing event handling logic. Have a look at existing
    events.

    When defining ways to store event information along with the handler in
    your custom event, you need to implement logic to resolve
    :attr:`HandlerInfo.event_type` to your custom event, while preserving
    existing resolver given in :func:`get_event_class`. For example, define
    :attr:`Event.event_type` to a unique (among all possible subclasses of
    Event) value and use the existing infrastructure

            from uun_iot.utils import classproperty

                    pass
                def stop(self):
                    pass

            def get_extended_event_class(ev_type):
                if ev_type == "myev":
                    return MyEvent
                else:
                    return get_event_class(ev_type)

            class TestClass:
                @MyEvent.subscribe
                def method(self):
                    pass

            # then, you can attach handlers such as:
            evs = attach_handlers({}, [TestClass()], get_ev_class=get_extended_event_class)
            print(evs)

Note:

    Note about standard Python behaviour. When a class's instance is
    created, the method is bound such that its first argument is the
    instance (the `self` argument). When invoking the instance's
    method, the augmented function is called instead.

Warning:

    Registering handlers not belong to any class (ie. handlers which are not
    methods) is currently not supported. Future versions might allow for
    registering "bare" handler functions.
