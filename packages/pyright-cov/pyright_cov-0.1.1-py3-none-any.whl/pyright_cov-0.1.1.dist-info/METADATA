# pyright-cov

## Enforce minimum type coverage!

`pyright-cov` is a tool which you can use to enforce minimum type coverage in your projects.

## Installation

```console
pip install pyright-cov
```

## Usage

In a virtual environment in which you have a local install of a library `foo`, you can
ensure that `foo` is type-complete with:

```
pyright-cov --verifytypes foo --ignoreexternal
```

This will fail (i.e. exit `1`) if your type coverage is less than 100%. To set a lower
threshold, such as 60%:

```
pyright-cov --verifytypes foo --ignoreexternal --fail-under 60
```

Additional command-line flags are passed to [PyRight](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).

## Testing

Make sure you have `uv` and `pytest` installed. Then, run:

```
pytest tests
```
