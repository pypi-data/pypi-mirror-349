## Openstack summary 

This will list instances with their costs, backups, images, volumes, etc.

### 1. As a client

In your terminal, type this command : 
  ```sh
  python3 openstack_summary.py
  ```

By default, you can see the last hour of billing (simply press enter), but you can choose the dates you want.

### 2. As an admin (beta)

As an Openstack admin, maybe you don't want to see the costs of all the instance, but you need to see a specific project.
  ```sh
  python3 openstack_admin_script.py
  ```

## Openstack optimization

This will list inactive instances, unused volumes, and analyze the ressource usage with lost costs for the last week.

In your terminal, type this command : 
  ```sh
  python3 openstack_optimization.py
  ```

### Weekly notification

In your terminal, type this command : 
  ```sh
  python weekly_notification_optimization.py
  ```

You will have to configure SMTP services in order to send emails.
It will suggest you to add a cron tab every monday at 08 am.
