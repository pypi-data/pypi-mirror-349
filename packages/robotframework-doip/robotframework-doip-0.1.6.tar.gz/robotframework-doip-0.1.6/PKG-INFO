# Package Description

RobotFramework DoIP is a Robot Framework library specifically designed
for interacting with Electronic Control Units (ECUs) using the
Diagnostics over Internet Protocol (DoIP).

At its core, DoIP serves as a communication bridge between external
diagnostic tools and a vehicle\'s ECUs. This library,
RobotFrameworkDoIP, provides a set of keywords that enable users to
perform diagnostic operations and engage with ECUs, facilitating
automated testing processes and interaction with vehicles through the
DoIP protocol.

# How to install

1.  Installation via GitHub (recommended for developers)
    -   Clone the **RobotFramework-DoIP** in
        [GitHub](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-doip)
        repository to your machine.

        ``` 
        git clone https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-doip.git
        ```

    -   Install dependencies

        **RobotFramework-DoIP** requires some additional Python
        libraries. Before you install the cloned repository sources you
        have to install the dependencies manually. The names of all
        related packages you can find in the file `requirements.txt` in
        the repository root folder. Use pip to install them:

        ``` 
        pip install -r ./requirements.txt
        ```

        Additionally install **LaTeX** (recommended: TeX Live). This is
        used to render the documentation.

    -   Configure dependencies

        The installation of **RobotFramework-DoIP** includes to generate
        the documentation in PDF format. This is done by an application
        called **GenPackageDoc**, that is part of the installation
        dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).

        **GenPackageDoc** uses **LaTeX** to generate the documentation
        in PDF format. Therefore **GenPackageDoc** needs to know where
        to find **LaTeX**. This is defined in the **GenPackageDoc**
        configuration file

        ``` 
        packagedoc\packagedoc_config.json
        ```

        Before you start the installation you have to introduce the
        following environment variable, that is used in
        `packagedoc_config.json`:

        -   `GENDOC_LATEXPATH` : path to `pdflatex` executable

    -   Use the following command to install **RobotFramework-DoIP**:

        ``` 
        setup.py install
        ```
