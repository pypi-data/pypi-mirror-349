# Scientific Microservices Python Wrapper

This Python module provides a simple interface to the APIs offered by [Scientific Microservices](https://scientificmicroservices.com/how-it-works). These APIs deliver lightweight, cloud-hosted scientific models designed for rapid data analysis and preprocessing.

## Features

- **Simple Interface** – Invoke scientific models with minimal code.
- **Fast Responses** – Get results in milliseconds.
- **Chainable APIs** – Combine multiple APIs for advanced workflows.
- **Stateless Operations** – Each call is independent.
- **Secure Communication** – All data is transmitted over secure protocols.

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install ScientificMicroservices
```

## Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the wrapper:

```python
from ScientificMicroservices import DetectOutliers
# Initialize the API client
api_key = os.environ("api_key")

# Define the input data
input_data = [1, 2, 4, 5, 40, 3, 5, 6]

# Call the API
outliers = DetectOutliers(input_data, api_key)

# Process the response
print(response)

```
Replace DetectOutliers with the specific API you wish to use and adjust the input_data accordingly.

## Documentation

For detailed information on available models and their parameters, please refer to the README on the Rapid product page of the relevant API.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve this wrapper or add support for additional models, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
