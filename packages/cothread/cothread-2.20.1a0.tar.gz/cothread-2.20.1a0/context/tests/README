Some of the files in this directory are useful for development testing.

bigtest.py
    A nice test of catools fetching a largeish number of PVs.

coco.py
    Simple sanity check: spawns a number of cothreads which themselves simply
    perform a number of task switches, and waits for them to complete.  If this
    fails then something is comprehensively broken!

coroutine.c
    A very simple coroutine implementation on top of the frame switching code.
    Usefuly for tests of the frame switching code, but more Python state is
    needed for use as a cothread support framework.

coroutine.h
    Interface provided by coroutine.c.

leak.py
    Mostly a relic of some earlier memory leak testing.

Makefile
    Binds coroutine.c and testco.c into a working program.

pyco.py
    A nice direct sanity check of the _coroutine Python extension.  Like
    coco.py, if this fails switching or _coroutine is broken.

testco.c
    Tests coroutine.c and hence the configured switch mechanism.

test.py
    A test of spawning a large number of tasks.  Breaks coroutine.c as a Python
    frame switching mechanism, because the Python interpreter thinks there's
    been a stack overflow.

timing.py
    Framework for some more serious timing tests.
