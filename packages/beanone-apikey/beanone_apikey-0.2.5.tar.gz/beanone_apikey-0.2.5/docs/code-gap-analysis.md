## Notes
- This analysis is based on the current codebase and system architecture requirements
- Priorities may change based on business requirements
- Some gaps may be addressed by external services or tools
- Implementation details should be discussed with the team
- Security and database issues should be addressed first
- Consider implementing features incrementally
- Consider using existing libraries for common functionality
- Consider implementing monitoring early for better visibility
