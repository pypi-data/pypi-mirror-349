# Project Template for BHKLab Projects

## How this works

This project uses the [copier tool](https://copier.readthedocs.io) to maintain
a standardized project template that follows the general structure of BHKLab
repositories.

Copier facilitates the management of project templates by
using [jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templating for file/directory
names and content in the template.

## Project Status and Roadmap

> [!NOTE]
> This section tracks the development progress of the BHKLab project template.

### Project Overview

The BHKLab project template aims to provide:

- Simple project setup with pixi, mkdocs, and basic DMP folder structure
- Support for reproducible research with proper documentation
- GitHub integrations and standardized workflow

## Requirements

**1: Make sure you have the `pixi` tool installed.**

Visit the [pixi documentation](https://pixi.sh)

The following two commands should work:

```console
pixi exec gh --help

pixi exec copier --help
```

**2: Make sure you have logged in to GitHub CLI.**

```console
pixi exec gh auth login --hostname 'github.com' --git-protocol https
```

Follow the instructions to authenticate with your GitHub account.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you have been added to our lab organization(s) before proceeding!

## Usage

**Run the following command to create a new project.**
**Replace `<PROJECT_NAME>` with the name of your project.**

- i.e `gdcs-drug-combo` would create a directory called `gdcs-drug-combo`

```console
pixi exec copier copy --trust gh:bhklab/bhklab-project-template <PROJECT_NAME>
```

### Latest Meeting Notes (Apr 25, 2025)

**Template Ideas:**

- Simple/Project structure with pixi, mkdocs, basic DMP folder setup
- Package development templates for R and Python with project toml, ruff, CodeRabbit, Code coverage

**MkDocs Components:**

- Home
- How to run code
- Where to get data
- Working notes
- Documenting symbolic links

**GitHub Actions:**

- Check for presence of rawdata, procdata, results directories
- Documentation audits
- Optional CodeRabbit integration

**Action Items:**

- Complete initial template structure âœ“
- Document DMP best practices âœ“
- Setup GitHub Actions workflows ðŸš§
- Test with real projects ðŸš§

## Troubleshooting

I have tried to simplify this setup as much as possible including the setup
of the remote GitHub repository and the GitHub Actions workflow, and deploying
the documentation to GitHub Pages.
However in case you run into issues, here are some troubleshooting steps.

<details>
<summary>extra setup steps if needed</summary>

## Setting up GitHub Actions

**Step 1: Go to `settings` > `Actions` > `General` in your GitHub repository.**

**Step 2: Select `Allow all actions and reusable workflows` in the `Workflow permissions` section + CLICK `Save`**

**Step 3: Scroll down to the `Workflow permissions` section and select `Read and write permissions AND Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests`**

## Setting up GitHub Pages

>[!NOTE]
> Before being able to deploy the documentation, you need to set up GitHub Pages.
> This is a one-time setup for the repository. The documentation will be deployed
> automatically to GitHub Pages when you push to the `main` branch.
> However, you need to create a `gh-pages` branch in your repository.
> You can do this by running the following command:
    ```console
    git branch gh-pages
    git push origin gh-pages
    ```
> This is only possible after you have created the repository on GitHub.

The template will use mkdocs to build the documentation and deploy it to GitHub Pages.
To set up GitHub Pages, follow these steps:
**Step 1: Go to `settings` > `Pages` in your GitHub repository.**

**Step 2: Select `Deploy from a branch` in the `Source` section.**

**Step 3: Select `gh-pages` branch and `/ (root)` folder in the `Branch` section.**

**Step 4: Click `Save`.**
