```

make sure you install ollama, and set it's url in the ollama client initializations
# Roadmap

- [x] integrate mcp into the chat context(currently it's history aware only)
- [x] Allow for streamlit pages/navigation
- [x] unify streamlit server(s) to initiate all of the frontend once
- [x] add more mcp servers
- [ ] allow for dynamically loading of mcp servers
- [x] create a malicious server
- [ ] perfrom mcp attacks and poc vulnerabilities
