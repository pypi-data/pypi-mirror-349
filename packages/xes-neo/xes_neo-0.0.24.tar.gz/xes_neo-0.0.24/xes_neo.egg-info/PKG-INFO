# XES_Neo
#### Versions: 0.0.24
#### Last update: April, 10, 2025 #Constant updates
#### LANL O#: O4887

This program utilizes a genetic algorithm in fitting of XES data

## Pre-requisites
Usage of this software is highly recommend to use `anaconda` or `pip` package managers.

  - Python: => 3.9
  - Numpy: => 1.20
  - Scipy: => 1.6
  - Matplotlib: > 3.0
  - Numba: => 0.60

It is highly recommend to create a new environment in `anaconda` to prevent packages conflicts.

        conda create --name xes_neo python>=3.8
        conda activate xes_neo


## Installations
To install XES_Neo, simply clone the repo:

        git clone https://github.com/lanl/XES_Neo_Public.git 
        cd xes
        pip install .


## Usage
To run a sample test, make sure the environment is set correctly, and select a input file:

        xes_neo -i test/test.ini

## Update
XES Neo is under active development, to update the code after pulling from the repository:

        git pull
        pip install .
## GUI

We also have provided a GUI for use in additions to our program, with additional helper script to facilitate post-analysis. To use the GUI:

        cd gui
        python xes_neo_gui.py

The GUI allows for custom parameters for different indentator during the post-analysis process.

## Potential Errors
If you get an error message involving psutl, make sure you are in the right conda environment and install psutil

        conda activate xps_neo
        conda install psutl
