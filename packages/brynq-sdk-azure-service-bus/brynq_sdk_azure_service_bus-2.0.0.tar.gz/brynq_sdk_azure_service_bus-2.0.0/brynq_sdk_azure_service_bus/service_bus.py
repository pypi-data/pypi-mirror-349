        Retrieves messages from a specified Azure Service Bus subscription and topic,

        This method connects to the Azure Service Bus using the client initialized in the constructor,
        receives messages in batches from the specified subscription and topic, and processes each message.
        The processing involves decoding the message body, parsing it as JSON, and then appending the message
        details along with the JSON data to a pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame is structured with predefined columns.
        If no more messages are received within the specified wait time, the method exits the loop and returns the DataFrame.

        Parameters:
        - subscription_name (str): The name of the subscription from which messages are to be received.
        - topic_name (str): The name of the topic from which messages are to be received.

        - pd.DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame containing the message details and the data extracted from each message.
                        The columns of the DataFrame are ['message_id', 'session_id', 'body', 'processing_status'],

        Sends a message to a specified Azure Service Bus topic.

        This method serializes a given message into JSON format and sends it to the specified topic on the Azure Service Bus.
        It sets additional application properties for the message, including direction, entity, action, and version, which can
        be used for routing or processing logic in receivers. The message is sent within a session, allowing for session-based
        message sequencing and grouping.

        Parameters:
        - topic_name (str): The name of the topic to which the message will be sent.
        - message (dict): The message payload to be sent, which will be serialized to JSON.
        - session_id (str): The session ID to associate with the message, enabling session-based messaging. If not provided, a timestamp is used.
        - direction (str): optional: The direction property of the message, typically used to indicate the message flow.
        - entity (str): optional: The entity property of the message, usually indicating the target entity type.

       Removes a specific message from a queue based on its message ID.

       This method connects to the Azure Service Bus using the client initialized in the constructor,

       If a message with the specified message ID is found, it is completed (acknowledged) which effectively
       removes it from the queue. This method is useful for processing and removing messages selectively

       - subscription_name (str): The name of the subscription from which messages are to be received and removed.
       - topic_name (str): The name of the topic from which messages are to be received and removed.
       - message_ids (list): A list of messages to remove. Always remove multiple messages in one call. We have to download the messages first to get the message ID. If
       you remove one by one, you have to download the messages multiple times.

       Note:
       This method assumes that the message ID is unique within the batch of retrieved messages.
