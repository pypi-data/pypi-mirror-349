# tidycensus

A Python wrapper for the U.S. Census Bureau API.

The design of this project was heavily inspired by the
[tidycensus](https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus) package in R.

## Usage

```python
# TODO: write example of fetching data

# TODO: example of fetching entire table
```

To find the alphanumeric codes for the variables you are interested in, I
recommend searching on the
[Census Bureau website](https://data.census.gov/table).

There is also specific functionality to extract estimates and standard errors
from the American Community Survey.

```python
# TODO: write example of acs api
```
