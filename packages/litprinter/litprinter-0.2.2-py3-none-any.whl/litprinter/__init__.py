This module provides enhanced print and logging functionalities for Python,
allowing developers to debug their code with style and precision. It
includes the litprint and lit functions for debugging, log for logging, and
install/uninstall functions for integration into the builtins module.
It also handles colorizing output and provides different styles and customizable
options.

LITPRINTER is inspired by the icecream package and provides similar functionality
with additional features:
- Variable inspection with expression display
- Return value handling for inline usage
- Support for custom formatters for specific data types
- Execution context tracking
- Rich-like colorized output with multiple themes (JARVIS, RICH, MODERN, NEON, CYBERPUNK)
- Better JSON formatting with indent=2 by default
- Advanced pretty printing for complex data structures with smart truncation
- Clickable file paths in supported terminals and editors (VSCode compatible)
- Enhanced visual formatting with better spacing and separators
- Special formatters for common types (Exception, bytes, set, frozenset, etc.)
- Smart object introspection for custom classes
- Logging capabilities with timestamp and log levels
