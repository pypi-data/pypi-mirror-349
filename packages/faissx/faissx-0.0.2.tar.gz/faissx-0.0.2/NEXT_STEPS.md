- [x] Directory structure reorganized (faissx, client, server, examples, data)
- [x] Build system configured (setup.py, MANIFEST.in)
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Basic Docker deployment

### Server Implementation (Complete ✅)
- [x] Create ZeroMQ server application structure
- [x] Implement authentication with API keys
- [x] Create FAISS manager for vector operations
- [x] Implement basic binary protocol for CRUD routes for indices
- [x] Implement vector addition and search operations
- [x] Add tenant isolation
- [x] Create Docker container setup
- [x] Create comprehensive server documentation

### Client Implementation (Complete ✅)
- [x] Create client package structure
- [x] Implement configuration management
- [x] Implement remote API client using ZeroMQ
- [x] Create IndexFlatL2 implementation with API parity
- [x] Add documentation for client usage
- [x] Implement drop-in replacement behavior
- [x] Create test suite for client functionality

## Next Milestones

### Server Enhancements
- [ ] Add support for additional FAISS index types:
  - [ ] IndexIVFFlat
  - [ ] IndexHNSW
  - [ ] IndexPQ
- [ ] Implement index training endpoints
- [ ] Add specialized search operations (range search, etc.)
- [ ] Implement proper deletion through index rebuilding
- [ ] Add benchmarking tools

### Client Library Enhancements
- [ ] Implement additional FAISS index classes
- [ ] Add support for index training
- [ ] Implement metadata filtering
- [ ] Add error recovery and reconnection
- [ ] Create advanced examples and tutorials
- [ ] Support for batch operations

### Packaging and Distribution
- [ ] Publish to PyPI
- [ ] Create standalone binaries
- [ ] Publish Docker images to Docker Hub
- [ ] Create automated build and test pipeline

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Optimize persistence layer for large indices
- [ ] Add GPU support via FAISS GPU indices
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed indices
- [ ] Add monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Support for distributed indices
- [ ] High availability configuration

## Implementation Priorities

### High Priority
1. Publish to PyPI
2. Support for additional index types (IndexIVFFlat)
3. Implement proper index training
4. Create detailed documentation and examples
   - [x] Comprehensive server documentation
   - [x] Client API documentation
   - [ ] More advanced examples and tutorials

### Medium Priority
1. Add more client-side features and FAISS compatibility
2. Create benchmarking tools
3. Add performance optimizations
4. Implement metadata filtering

### Low Priority
1. GPU support
2. Monitoring dashboard
3. Additional language clients (TypeScript, Go, etc.)

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions to the FAISSx project. Here are some ways to get started:

1. Try out the current implementation and provide feedback
2. Help with additional index type implementation
3. Create examples and tutorials
4. Improve documentation
   - Server and client core documentation is complete
   - Help with advanced usage examples and tutorials
5. Add benchmarking and performance tests
