# Pyharp: High-performance Atmosphere Radiation Package in Python

## Installation

Pyharp can be installed on either a Linux distribution or on MacOS via ``pip``:

```bash
pip install pyharp
```

You can also install it locally, which allows you to modify the source code and test it locally.
Open a Linux or Mac terminal and clone this repo using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chengcli/pyharp
```

This will copy all source files into your local computer. You will need to install a few
system libraries before installing Pyharp. All following instructions are executed under
the `pyharp/` directory.

### System required for building locally
- Python 3.9+
- Linux or macOS
- netCDF
- python virtual environment (venv)

#### MacOS installation
```bash
brew install netcdf
```

#### RedHat installation
```bash
sudo yum install netcdf
```

#### Ubuntu installation
```bash
sudo apt-get install libnetcdf-dev
```

### Build C++ library
After you completed the installation steps, you can build the pyharp library.
We will build the package in-place, meaning that the build (binary files) are
located under `pyharp/build/bin`. To do so, make a new directory named `build`
```
mkdir build
```
All build files will be generated and placed under this directory. It is completely safe
to delete the whole directory if you want another build. `cd` to build and `cmake`

```
cd build
cmake ..
```
This command tells the cmake command to look for `CMakeFiles.txt` in the parent directory,
and start configuring the compile environment. Then compile the code by
```
make -j4
```
This comman will use 4 cores to compile the code in parallel. Once complete, all executable
files will be placed in `build/bin`.

### Build python package locally (dev mode)
The python library can be installed by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Test the installation
To test the installation, import pyharp in a python shell:
```python
import pyharp
```
The build is successful if you do not see any error messages.
Detailed documentation and examples are available at [https://pyharp.readthedocs.io](https://pyharp.readthedocs.io).
