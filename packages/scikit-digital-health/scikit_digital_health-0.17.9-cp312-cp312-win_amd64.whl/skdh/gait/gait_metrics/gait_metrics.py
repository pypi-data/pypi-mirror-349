    Notes
    -----
    The step length for model 2 is computed using the double inverted pendulum model
    from [1]_ per

    .. math:: L_{step} = 2 \\sqrt{2l_{leg}h - h^2} + 2\\sqrt{2l'h' - h'^2}

    where :math:`L_{step}` is the step length, :math:`l_{leg}` is the leg length,
    :math:`h` is the center of mass (COM) change in height during the single support
    phase of a step, :math:`l'` is the double support pendulum length, and
    :math:`h'` is the change in height of the COM during the initial double
    support phase of a step.

    However, now because we don't have an exact measurement of :math:`l'`, we have
    to estimate it. From [2]_, the actual estimation would rely on the distance
    covered during initial double support (ids) and single support (ss) phases, per

    .. math:: \\frac{L_{ids}}{L_{ss}} = \\frac{l'}{l_{leg}}

    However, since the distances are what we are trying to estimate, we have to
    approximate this. The most obvious would be to see if the ratio of time
    in ids and ss would work:

    .. math:: \\frac{T_{ids}}{T_{ss}} \\approx \\frac{l'}{l_{leg}}

    And from experimental results, this approximation is close, but needs to be
    scaled slightly on a quadratic:

    .. math:: 1.12 \\left(\\frac{T_{ids}}{T_{ss}}\\right)^2 + 0.547\\frac{T_{ids}}{T_{ss}} + 0.066

class HarmonicRatioV(GaitEventEndpoint):
    r"""
    Symmetry measure of the 2 steps that occur during each stride. It attempts to capture this
    relationship by looking at the frequency components for steps and strides and creating a ratio
    using these values. Higher values indicate better symmetry between the steps occuring during
    an individual stride.

    Notes
    -----
    The Harmonic ratio is computed from the first 20 harmonics extracted from a fourier series.
    For the vertical direction, the HR is defined as

    .. math:: HR = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{10}F(2nf_{stride})}{\sum_{n=1}^{10}F((2n-1)f_{stride})}

    where :math:`F` is the power spectral density and :math:`f_{stride}` is the stride frequency.
    Since this is computed on a per-stride basis, the stride frequency is estimated as the inverse
    of stride time for the individual stride.

class PhaseCoordinationIndex(GaitBoutEndpoint):
    r"""
    Assessment of the symmetry between steps during straight overground gait.
    Computed for an entire bout, it is a measure of the deviation from symmetrical steps (ie half a
    stride is equal to exactly 1 step duration). Lower values indicate better symmetry and
    a "more consistent and accurate phase generation" [2]_.

    Notes
    -----
    The computation of PCI relies on the assumption that healthy gait is perfectly even, with
    step times being exactly half of stride times. This assumption informs the definition
    of the PCI, where the perfect step phase is set to :math:`180^\circ`. To compute PCI, the
    phase is first computed for each stride as the relative step to stride time in degrees,

    .. math:: \varphi_i = 360^\circ\left(\frac{hs_{i+1}-hs_{i}}{hs_{i+2}-hs{i}}\right)

    where :math:`hs_i` is the *ith* heel-strike. Then over the whole bout, the mean absolute
    difference from :math:`180^\circ` is computed as :math:`\varphi_{ABS}`,

    .. math:: \varphi_{ABS} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}|\varphi_i - 180^\circ|

    The coefficient of variation (:math:`\varphi_{CV}`) is also computed for phase,

    .. math: \varphi_{CV} = 100\frac{s_{\varphi}}{\bar{\varphi}}

    where :math:`\bar{\varphi}` and :math:`s_{\varphi}` are the sample mean and standard deviation
    of :math:`\varphi` respectively. Finally, the PCI is computed per

    .. math:: PCI = \varphi_{CV} + 100\frac{\varphi_{ABS}}{180}

class GaitSymmetryIndex(GaitBoutEndpoint):
    r"""
    Assessment of the symmetry between steps during straight overground gait. It is computed for
    an entire bout. Values closer to 1 indicate higher symmetry, while values close to 0 indicate
    lower symmetry.

    Notes
    -----
    If the minimum gait window time is less than 4.5 seconds, there may be issues with this
    endpoint for those with slow gait (those with stride lengths approaching the minimum gait
    window time).

    GSI is computed using the biased autocovariance of the acceleration after being filtered
    through a 4th order 10Hz cutoff butterworth low-pass filter. [1]_ and [2]_ use the
    autocorrelation, instead of autocovariance, however subtracting from the compared signals
    results in a better mathematical comparison of the symmetry of the acceleration profile of the
    gait. The biased autocovariance is used to suppress the value at higher lags [1]_. In order to
    ensure that full steps/strides are capture, the maximum lag for the autocorrelation is set to
    4s, which should include several strides in healthy adults, and account for more than
    2.5 strides in impaired populations, such as hemiplegic stroke patients [3]_.

    With the autocovariances computed for all 3 acceleration axes, the coefficient of stride
    repetition (:math:`C_{stride}`) is computed for lag :math:`m` per

    .. math:: C_{stride}(m) = K_{AP}(m) + K_{V}(m) + K_{ML}(m)

    where :math:`K_{x}` is the autocovariance in the :math:`x` direction - Anterior-Posterior (AP),
    Medial-Lateral (ML), or vertical (V). The coefficient of step repetition (:math:`C_{step}`)
    is the norm of :math:`C_{stride}`

    .. math:: C_{step}(m) = \sqrt{C_{stride}(m)} = \sqrt{K_{AP}(m) + K_{V}(m) + K_{ML}(m)}

    Under the assumption that perfectly symmetrical gait will have step durations equal to half
    the stride duration, the GSI is computed per

    .. math:: GSI = C_{step}(0.5m_{stride}) / \sqrt{3}

    where :math:`m_{stride}` is the lag for the average stride in the gait bout, and corresponds to
    a local maximum in the autocovariance function. To find the peak corresponding to
    :math:`m_{stride}` the peak nearest to the average stride time for the bout is used. GSI is
    normalized by :math:`\sqrt{3}` in order to have a maximum value of 1.

class StepRegularityV(GaitBoutEndpoint):
    """
    The autocovariance at a lag time of 1 step for the vertical acceleration. Computed for an
    entire bout of gait, it is a measure of the average symmetry of sequential steps during
    overground strait gait. Values close to 1 indicate high degree of regularity/symmetry, while
    values close to 0 indicate a low degree of regularity/symmetry.

    Notes
    -----
    If the minimum gait window time is less than 4.5 seconds, there may be issues with this
    endpoint for those with slow gait (those with stride lengths approaching the minimum gait
    window time).

    Step regularity is the value of the autocovariance function at a lag equal to the time
    for one step. While [2]_ uses the autocorrelation instead of the autocovariance like [1]_, the
    autocovariance is used here as it provides a mathematically better comparison of the
    acceleration profile during gait.

    The peak corresponding to one step time is found by searching the area near the lag
    corresponding to the average step time for the gait bout. The nearest peak to this point is
    used as the peak at a lag of one step.

class StrideRegularityV(GaitBoutEndpoint):
    """
    Autocovariance at a lag time of 1 stride for the vertical acceleration. Computed for an
    entire bout of gait, it is a measure of the average symmetry of sequential stride during
    overground strait gait. Values close to 1 indicate high degree of regularity/symmetry, while
    values close to 0 indicate a low degree of regularity/symmetry.

    Notes
    -----
    If the minimum gait window time is less than 4.5 seconds, there may be issues with this
    endpoint for those with slow gait (those with stride lengths approaching the minimum gait
    window time).

    Stride regularity is the value of the autocovariance function at a lag equal to the time
    for one stride. While [2]_ uses the autocorrelation instead of the autocovariance like [1]_,
    the autocovariance is used here as it provides a mathematically better comparison of the
    acceleration profile during gait.

    The peak corresponding to one stride time is found by searching the area near the lag
    corresponding to the average stride time for the gait bout. The nearest peak to this point is
    used as the peak at a lag of one stride.

class RegularityIndexV(GaitBoutEndpoint):
    r"""
    The combination of both step and stride regularity into one endpoint. The goal is to provide an
    assessment of the regularity for consecutive steps and strides, for the vertical axis
    acceleration. Values closer to 1 indicate high levels of symmetry between left and right steps.

    Notes
    -----
    The vertical axis regularity index :math:`R_V` is simply defined per

    .. math:: R_V = 1 - |R_{(stride, V)} - R_{(step, V)}|\frac{2}{R_{(stride, V)} + R_{(step, V)}}

    where :math:`R_{(stride, V)}` is the stride regularity for the vertical axis (same notation for
    step regularity).

    The Regularity Index term came from [1]_, where it was defined without the subtraction from 1.
    However, the definition from [2]_ (under the term "symmetry") keeps the values in the same
    range as others (including step/stride regularity), aiding in ease of interpretation.
    "Regularity Index" however serves to eliminate confusion given other endpoints already labeled
    with "symmetry" in the name.
