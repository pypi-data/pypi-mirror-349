    """
    Compute the period of time in which sleep can occur for a given days worth of data.
    For this algorithm, it is the longest period of wear-time that has low activity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fs : float
        Sampling frequency of the time and acceleration data, in Hz.
    time : numpy.ndarray
        Timestamps for the acceleration.
    accel : numpy.ndarray
        (N, 3) array of acceleration values in g.
    temperature : numpy.ndarray
        (N, 3) array of temperature values in celsius.
    wear_starts : {numpy.ndarray, None}
        Indices for the starts of wear-time. Note that while `time` and `accel` should
        be the values for one day, `wear_starts` is likely indexed to the whole data
        series. This offset can be adjusted by `idx_start`. If indexing only into
        the one day, `idx_start` should be 0. If None, will compute wear internally.
    wear_stops : {numpy.ndarray, None}
        Indices for the stops of wear-time. Note that while `time` and `accel` should
        be the values for one day, `wear_stops` is likely indexed to the whole data
        series. This offset can be adjusted by `idx_start`. If indexing only into
        the one day, `idx_start` should be 0. If None, will compute wear internally.
    min_rest_block : int
        Minimum number of minutes that a rest period can be
    max_act_break : int
        Maximum number of minutes an active block can be so that it doesn't interrupt
        a longer rest period.
    tso_min_thresh : float
        Minimum angle value the TSO threshold can be.
    tso_max_thresh : float
        Maximum angle value the TSO threshold can be.
    tso_perc : int
        The percentile to use when calculating the TSO threshold from daily data.
    tso_factor : float
        The factor to multiply the percentile value by co get the TSO threshold.
    int_wear_temp : float
        Internal wear temperature threshold in celsius.
    int_wear_move : float
        Internal wear movement threshold in g.
    plot_fn : function
        Plotting function for the arm angle.
    idx_start : int, optional
        Offset index for wear-time indices. If `wear_starts` and `wear_stops` are
        relative to the day of interest, then `idx_start` should equal 0.
    add_active_time : float, optional
        Add active time to the accelerometer signal start and end when detecting
        the total sleep opportunity. This can occasionally be useful if less than
        24 hrs of data are collected, as sleep-period skewed data can effect the
        sleep window cutoff, effecting the end results. Suggested is not adding
        more than 1.5 hours. Default is 0.0 for no added data.

    Returns
    -------
    start : float
        Total sleep opportunity start timestamp.
    stop : float
        Total sleep opportunity stop timestamp.
    arg_start : int
        Total sleep opportunity start index, into the specific period of time.
    arg_stop : int
        Total sleep opportunity stop index, into the specific period of time.
