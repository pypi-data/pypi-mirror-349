    """
    Apply the Cole-Kripke algorithm to activity index data

    Parameters
    ----------
    act_index : numpy.ndarray
        Activity index calculated from accelerometer data on 1 minute windows.
    sf : float, optional
        Scale factor used for the predictions. Default is 0.243, which was optimized
        for activity index. Recommended range if changing is between 0.15 and 0.3 depending
        on desired sensitivity, and possibly the population being observed.
    rescore : bool, optional
        If True, applies Webster's rescoring rules to the sleep predictions to improve
        specificity.

    Returns
    -------

    Notes
    -----
    Applies Webster's rescoring rules as described in the Cole-Kripke paper.
